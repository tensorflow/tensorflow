If you open a GitHub Issue, here is our policy:

1.  It must be a bug/performance issue or a feature request or a build issue or
    a documentation issue (for small doc fixes please send a PR instead).
1.  Make sure the Issue Template is filled out.
1.  The issue should be related to the repo it is created in.

**Here's why we have this policy:** We want to focus on the work that benefits
the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Individual support
should be sought on Stack Overflow or other non-GitHub channels. It helps us to
address bugs and feature requests promptly.
