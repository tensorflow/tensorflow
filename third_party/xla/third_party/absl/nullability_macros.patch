# absl_nonnull, absl_nullable, and absl_nullability_unknown are not yet present
# in the version of absl we are using. This patch can be removed when the absl
# version used is bumped to commit 48f0f91 or newer, unless the check for
# `ABSL_HAVE_FEATURE(nullability_on_classes)` is critical, which was added in
# commit 9e660cf.
