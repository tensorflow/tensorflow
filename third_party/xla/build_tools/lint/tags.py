"""Asserts all tags in XLA are documented.

`bazel query //xla/... --output=build` is read from stdin, and then we check
all tags are present in the `_TAGS_TO_DOCUMENTATION_MAP`. Ideally we would parse
using
https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/protobuf/build.proto
but this is not possible due to XLA's old protobuf version. So we parse by hand
instead.
