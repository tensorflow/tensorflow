# XLA

XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) is an open-source machine learning (ML)
compiler for GPUs, CPUs, and ML accelerators.

The XLA compiler takes models from popular ML frameworks such as PyTorch,
TensorFlow, and JAX, and optimizes them for high-performance execution across
different hardware platforms including GPUs, CPUs, and ML accelerators.

## Get started

If you want to use XLA to compile your ML project, refer to the corresponding
documentation for your ML framework:

* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/xla)
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla)
* [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html)

If you're not contributing code to the XLA compiler, you don't need to clone and
build this repo. Everything here is intended for XLA contributors who want to
develop the compiler and XLA integrators who want to debug or add support for ML
frontends and hardware backends.

## Contribute

If you'd like to contribute to XLA, review
[How to Contribute](docs/contributing.md) and then see the
[developer guide](docs/developer_guide.md).
