// This pass does "host memory offloading". If a tensor is annotated to be moved
// to or from the host, this pass will remove the annotations and update each
// tensor's layout with host memory spaces and insert copies if necessary. This
// pass checks to make sure that no compute is done on the tensors annotated for
// host memory offload; if there is compute, it is considered a user error and
// an error will be returned.
// The pass will "walk down" the Hlo graph starting from either MoveToHost
// custom calls or from parameters with host memory space in their layout. All
// tensors along each path have their memory space set as host memory space. If
// a MoveToHost custom call is paired with a DynamicUpdateSlice, the
// DynamicUpdateSlice will write into host memory space. Otherwise, a copy from
// device to host will be inserted.
//
// If an output of a host offloaded computation is only used on host, the memory
// space of the usages are updated to reflect it and no copies to and from host
// are performed. Any MoveToHost instructions for outputs used only on host, are
// removed.
// TODO(b/347101407): A better approach could be to remove redundant copies in a
// generalized fashion. Should also be moved out of Host Offloader.
//
// All MoveToHost and MoveToDevice custom calls are removed by the end of this
