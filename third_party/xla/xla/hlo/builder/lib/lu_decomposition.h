// Computes the LU decomposition with partial pivoting of a batch of matrices.
//
// Given a (batched) matrix a with shape [..., m, n], computes the matrix
// decomposition A = P @ L @ U where P is a permutation matrix, L is a
// lower-triangular matrix with unit diagonal entries, and U is an
// upper-triangular matrix.
//
// L and U are returned as a single matrix [..., m, n] containing both L and U
// packed in the same array. The unit diagonal of L is not represented
// explicitly.
//
// The permutation matrix P is returned in two forms, both as `pivots`, which is
// an s32[..., min(m, n)] array that describes a sequence of row-swaps in the
// style of LAPACK's xGETRF API, and `permutation`, which is a s32[..., m] array
// which gives the permutation to apply to the rows. We return both
// representations because they are each useful for different purposes; `pivots`
// is useful for computing the sign of a determinant, whereas `permutation` can
// be used via a Gather operation to permute the rows of a matrix.
//
// This method is only implemented on TPU at the moment.
// TODO(b/168208200): the implementation only supports F32 arrays. Handle the
// complex case.
