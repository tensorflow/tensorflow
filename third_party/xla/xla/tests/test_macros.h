// Macros for use in enabling/disabling tests on particular
// platforms. Marking a gunit test as disabled still ensures that it
// compiles.
//
// Implementation note: the macros are structured as follows:
// * Define the disabled macro to just pass the test name through (which, in
//   effect, does not disable it at all)
// * If a XLA_TEST_BACKEND_$TARGET macro indicates we're compiling for
//   $TARGET platform, make the disabled macro truly disable the test; i.e. by
//   redefining the DISABLED_ON_$TARGET macro to prepend "DISABLED_" to the test
//   name.
