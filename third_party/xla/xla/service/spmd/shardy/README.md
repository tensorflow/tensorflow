Shardy is a new partitioning system that is jointly developed by GDM and XLA
Horizontal Scaling teams. Its path is //third_party/openxla/shardy/.

This directory contains files integrating Shardy into the XLA compiler
pipeline. Once Shardy is released to the external developers, we will also
publicize this directory by moving it into
//third_party/tensorflow/compiler/xla/service/spmd/.
