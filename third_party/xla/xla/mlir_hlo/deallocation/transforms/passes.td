    A collection of transforms to eliminate allocations, in particular from
    loops:

    - Reuse of buffers (dealloc, alloc pairs)
    - Hoisting of allocations out of loops
    - Promotion of buffers to the stack
    - Double buffering

    For this pass to work properly, the following conditions must be met:

    - The input IR must have been generated by hlo-deallocate. This pass assumes
      invariants guaranteed by hlo-deallocate.
    - The IR must have been canonicalized at least once after hlo-deallocate.
