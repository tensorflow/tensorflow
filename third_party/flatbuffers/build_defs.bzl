          Other flatbuffer_cc_library's can pass this in for their `includes`

      Fileset([name]_reflection): (Optional) all generated reflection binaries.
      cc_library([name]): library with sources and flatbuffers deps.

    Remarks:
      ** Because the genrule used to call flatc does not have any trivial way of
        computing the output list of files transitively generated by includes and
        --gen-includes (the default) being defined for flatc, the --gen-includes
        flag will not work as expected. The way around this is to add a dependency
        to the flatbuffer_cc_library defined alongside the flatc included Fileset.
        For example you might define:

        flatbuffer_cc_library(
            name = "my_fbs",
            srcs = [ "schemas/foo.fbs" ],
            includes = [ "//third_party/bazz:bazz_fbs_includes" ],
        )

        In which foo.fbs includes a few files from the Fileset defined at
        //third_party/bazz:bazz_fbs_includes. When compiling the library that
        includes foo_generated.h, and therefore has my_fbs as a dependency, it
        will fail to find any of the bazz *_generated.h files unless you also
        add bazz's flatbuffer_cc_library to your own dependency list, e.g.:

        cc_library(
            name = "my_lib",
            deps = [
                ":my_fbs",
                "//third_party/bazz:bazz_fbs"
            ],
        )

        Happy dependent Flatbuffering!

    Args:
      name: Rule name.
      srcs: Source .fbs files. Sent in order to the compiler.

          filegroup into the `includes` parameter of any other
          flatbuffer_cc_library that depends on this one's schemas.

      flatc_args: Optional list of additional arguments to pass to flatc
          (e.g. --gen-mutable).
      visibility: The visibility of the generated cc_library. By default, use the
          default visibility of the project.
      srcs_filegroup_visibility: The visibility of the generated srcs filegroup.
          By default, use the value of the visibility parameter above.
      gen_reflections: Optional, if true this will generate the flatbuffer
        reflection binaries for the schemas.
