# How to Run the Script
This section explains how to install TensorFlow, use its basic functions, and run a sample Python script.

## Step 1: Install TensorFlow
Before you can use TensorFlow, you need to install it. Follow these steps to set up your environment:
1. Ensure you have Python installed. TensorFlow supports Python 3.7 to 3.10.
Check your Python version:
```shell
python --version
```
2. Install TensorFlow using pip:
```shell
pip install tensorflow
```

## Step 2: TensorFlow Function Example
Here is a simple example to demonstrate TensorFlow's functionality:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a constant tensor
hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')

# Start a session and print the result
print(hello.numpy())

```
Explanation:
- tf.constant: Creates a constant tensor.
- numpy(): Converts the tensor to a NumPy array for easy printing.
Save this example in a file named example.py.

## Step 3: Run a TensorFlow Script
To run a script using TensorFlow, follow these steps:
1. Write a Python script that uses TensorFlow functions. For example:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a simple computation graph
a = tf.constant(5)
b = tf.constant(3)
c = tf.add(a, b)

# Print the result
print(f"The sum of {a.numpy()} and {b.numpy()} is {c.numpy()}")

```
Save this as script.py.

2. Execute the script:
```shell
python script.py
```

3. Expected Output:
```text
The sum of 5 and 3 is 8
```

## Step 4: Run an Example Training Script
Hereâ€™s an example of training a simple neural network:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Generate sample data
x = tf.random.normal([1000, 2])
y = tf.reduce_sum(x, axis=1, keepdims=True)

# Define a simple model
model = Sequential([
    Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(2,)),
    Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model
model.fit(x, y, epochs=5, batch_size=32)

# Predict using the trained model
print(model.predict([[5.0, 3.0]]))
```
Save this script as train_model.py and run it:
```shell
python train_model.py
```

### Notes:
- For GPU support, install the GPU version of TensorFlow:
  - Ensure your system has the required CUDA and cuDNN versions installed.
```shell
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```

- For more advanced examples, refer to the [official TensorFlow tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials).
