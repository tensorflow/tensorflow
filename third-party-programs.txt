      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
	non-exclusive license:

	(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
		Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
		modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
		Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
		as part of a Larger Work; and

		Contributions or its Contributor Version.

	2.2. Effective Date

	The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
	become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
	distributes such Contribution.

	2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

	The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
	this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
	distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
	Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
	Contributor:

	(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
		or

	(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
		modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
		Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
		Version); or

	(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
		its Contributions.

	This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
	or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
	the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

	2.4. Subsequent Licenses

	No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
	distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
	License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
	permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

	2.5. Representation

	Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
	Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
	to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

	2.6. Fair Use

	This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
	applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
	equivalents.

	2.7. Conditions

	Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
	in Section 2.1.

	3. Responsibilities
	-------------------

	3.1. Distribution of Source Form

	All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
	Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
	the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
	Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
	License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
	attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
	Form.

	3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

	If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

	(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
		Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
		the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
		Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
		than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

	(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
		License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
		license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
		the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

	3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

	You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
	provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
	the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
	Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
	Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
	License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
	under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
	the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
	Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
	License(s).

	3.4. Notices

	You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
	(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
	or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
	the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
	the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

	3.5. Application of Additional Terms

	You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
	indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
	Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
	behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
	such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
	You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
	liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
	indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
	disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
	jurisdiction.

	4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
	---------------------------------------------------

	If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
	License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
	statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
	the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
	describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
	be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
	Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
	or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
	recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

	5. Termination
	--------------

	5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
	if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
	compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
	Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
	Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
	ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
	non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
	come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
	Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
	notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
	first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
	from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
	Your receipt of the notice.

	5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
	infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
	counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
	directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
	You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
	2.1 of this License shall terminate.

	5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
	end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
	have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
	prior to termination shall survive termination.

	*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
	*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
	*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
	*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
	*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
	*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
	*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
	*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
	*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
	*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *

	*                                                                      *

	*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *
	*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *

	8. Litigation
	-------------

	Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
	courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
	place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
	jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
	Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
	cross-claims or counter-claims.

	9. Miscellaneous
	----------------

	This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
	matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
	unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
	necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
	that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
	shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

	10. Versions of the License
	---------------------------

	10.1. New Versions

	Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
	10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
	publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
	distinguishing version number.

	10.2. Effect of New Versions

	You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
	of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
	or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
	steward.

	10.3. Modified Versions

	If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
	create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
	modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
	any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
	such modified license differs from this License).

	10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
	Licenses

	If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
	Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
	notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

	Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice
	-------------------------------------------

	  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public
	  License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this
	  file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

	If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
	file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
	file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look
	for such a notice.

	You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

	Exhibit B - "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" Notice
	---------------------------------------------------------

	  This Source Code Form is "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses", as
	  defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

	MPL 2.0 (and others)
	
	Eigen is primarily MPL2 licensed. See COPYING.MPL2 and these links:
	  http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/
	  http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/FAQ.html

	Some files contain third-party code under BSD or LGPL licenses, whence the other
	COPYING.* files here.

	All the LGPL code is either LGPL 2.1-only, or LGPL 2.1-or-later.
	For this reason, the COPYING.LGPL file contains the LGPL 2.1 text.

	If you want to guarantee that the Eigen code that you are #including is licensed
	under the MPL2 and possibly more permissive licenses (like BSD), #define this
	preprocessor symbol:
	  EIGEN_MPL2_ONLY
	For example, with most compilers, you could add this to your project CXXFLAGS:
	  -DEIGEN_MPL2_ONLY
	This will cause a compilation error to be generated if you #include any code that is
	LGPL licensed.

25.sqlite
    
	public domain
	
	All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

	The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process (for example the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the SQLite library.

	All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.
