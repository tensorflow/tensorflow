        "TensorFlow gets its name from [tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor), which are arrays of arbitrary dimensionality. A vector is a 1-d array and is known as a 1st-order tensor. A matrix is a 2-d array and a 2nd-order tensor. The \"flow\" part of the name refers to computation flowing through a graph. Training and inference in a neural network, for example, involves the propagation of matrix computations through many nodes in a computational graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you think of doing things in TensorFlow, you might want to think of creating tensors (like matrices), adding operations (that output other tensors), and then executing the computation (running the computational graph). In particular, it's important to realize that when you add an operation on tensors, it doesn't execute immediately. Rather, TensorFlow waits for you to define all the operations you want to perform. Then, TensorFlow optimizes the computation graph, deciding how to execute the computation, before generating the data. Because of this, a tensor in TensorFlow isn't so much holding the data as a placeholder for holding the data, waiting for the data to arrive when a computation is executed."

When you create tensors and operations, they are not executed immediately, but wait for other operations and tensors to be added to the graph, only executing when finally requested to produce the results of the session. Deferring the execution like this provides additional opportunities for parallelism and optimization, as TensorFlow can decide how to combine operations and where to run them after TensorFlow knows about all the operations. \n",

If you look at the code for `constant`, you can see the details of what it is doing to create the tensor. In summary, it creates a tensor of the necessary shape and applies the constant operator to it to fill it with the provided values. The values to `constant` can be Python or numpy arrays. `constant` can take an optional shape parameter, which works similarly to numpy's `fill` if provided, and an optional name parameter, which can be used to put a more human-readable label on the operation in the TensorFlow operation graph.\n",

It returns this as a numpy array, which can then be printed. But, it's important to realize it also runs the computation graph at this point, because we demanded the output from the operation node of the graph; to produce that, it had to run the computation graph. So, this is the point where the addition is actually performed, not when `add` was called, as `add` just put the addition operation into the TensorFlow computation graph."
