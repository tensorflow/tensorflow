# This script is a wrapper creating inside container the same user as the one
# running the ci_build.sh outside of container. It also set the home for that
# user to in the workspace directory.
# We do this so that the bazel running inside container generate symbolic links
# and user permissions which makes sense outside of container.
# Do not run this outside of docker. It does not make sense.
