# Note: This file is given a descriptive name in the source tree.  However, for
# some reason, the command to create/update datastore indexes requires it to be
# named "index.yaml" even though the filename is given on the command line.  So
# make a copy of it into a temporary "index.yaml" file and issue this command:
# % gcloud datastore create-indexes index.yaml

# Index to access a specific (test, start) Entity, and also to be able to only
# fetch a range of start times of some test without fetching the "info" blob.
