## Introduction <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-introduction"></a>

TensorFlow&#8482; is an open source software library for numerical computation
using data flow graphs.  Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations,
while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that
flow between them.  This flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation
to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device without
rewriting code.  TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and
engineers working on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence
research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep
neural networks research.  The system is general enough to be applicable in a
wide variety of other domains as well.  The following documents show you how
to set up and use the TensorFlow system.
