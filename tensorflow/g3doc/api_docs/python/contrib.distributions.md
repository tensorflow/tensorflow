# Statistical distributions (contrib)
[TOC]

Classes representing statistical distributions and ops for working with them.

## Classes for statistical distributions.

Classes that represent batches of statistical distributions.  Each class is
initialized with parameters that define the distributions.

### Base classes

### `class tf.contrib.distributions.BaseDistribution` {#BaseDistribution}

Abstract base class for probability distributions.

This class, along with `ContinuousDistribution` and `DiscreteDistribution`,
defines the API for probability distributions.

Users will never instantiate a `BaseDistribution`, but will instead
instantiate subclasses of either `ContinuousDistribution` or
`DiscreteDistribution`.

Developers of new distributions should prefer to subclass
`ContinuousDistribution` or `DiscreteDistribution`.

### API

The key methods for probability distributions are defined here. The likelihood
functions (`pdf`, `log_pdf`) and (`pmf`, `log_pmf`) are defined in
`ContinuousDistribution` and `DiscreteDistribution`, respectively.

To keep ops generated by the distribution tied together by name, subclasses
should override `name` and use it to preprend names of ops in other methods
(see `cdf` for an example).

Subclasses that wish to support `cdf` and `log_cdf` can override `log_cdf`
and use the base class's implementation for `cdf`.

### Broadcasting, batching, and shapes

All distributions support batches of independent distributions of that type.
The batch shape is determined by broadcasting together the parameters.

The shape of arguments to `__init__`, `cdf`, `log_cdf`, and the likelihood
functions defined in `ContinuousDistribution` and `DiscreteDistribution`
reflect this broadcasting, as does the return value of `sample`.

`sample_shape = (n,) + batch_shape + event_shape`, where `sample_shape` is the
shape of the `Tensor` returned from `sample`, `n` is the number of samples,
`batch_shape` defines how many independent distributions there are, and
`event_shape` defines the shape of samples from each of those independent
distributions. Samples are independent along the `batch_shape` dimensions,
but not necessarily so along the `event_shape` dimensions (dependending on
the particulars of the underlying distribution).

Using the `Uniform` distribution as an example:

```python
minval = 3.0
maxval = [[4.0, 6.0],
          [10.0, 12.0]]

# Broadcasting:
# This instance represents 4 Uniform distributions. Each has a lower bound at
# 3.0 as the `minval` parameter was broadcasted to match `maxval`'s shape.
u = Uniform(minval, maxval)

# `event_shape` is `TensorShape([])`.
event_shape = u.get_event_shape()
# `event_shape_t` is a `Tensor` which will evaluate to [].
event_shape_t = u.event_shape

# Sampling returns a sample per distribution.  `samples` has shape
# (5, 2, 2), which is (n,) + batch_shape + event_shape, where n=5,
# batch_shape=(2, 2), and event_shape=().
samples = u.sample(5)

# The broadcasting holds across methods. Here we use `cdf` as an example. The
# same holds for `log_cdf` and the likelihood functions.

# `cum_prob` has shape (2, 2) as the `value` argument was broadcasted to the
# shape of the `Uniform` instance.
cum_prob_broadcast = u.cdf(4.0)

# `cum_prob`'s shape is (2, 2), one per distribution. No broadcasting
# occurred.
cum_prob_per_dist = u.cdf([[4.0, 5.0],
                           [6.0, 7.0]])

# INVALID as the `value` argument is not broadcastable to the distribution's
# shape.
cum_prob_invalid = u.cdf([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])

### Parameter values leading to undefined statistics or distributions.

Some distributions do not have well-defined statistics for all initialization
parameter values.  For example, the beta distribution is parameterized by
positive real numbers `a` and `b`, and does not have well-defined mode if
`a < 1` or `b < 1`.

The user is given the option of raising an exception or returning `NaN`.

```python
a = tf.exp(tf.matmul(logits, weights_a))
b = tf.exp(tf.matmul(logits, weights_b))

# Will raise exception if ANY batch member has a < 1 or b < 1.
dist = distributions.beta(a, b, strict_statistics=True)  # default is True
mode = dist.mode().eval()

# Will return NaN for batch members with either a < 1 or b < 1.
dist = distributions.beta(a, b, strict_statistics=False)
mode = dist.mode().eval()
```

In all cases, an exception is raised if *invalid* parameters are passed, e.g.

```python
# Will raise an exception if any Op is run.
negative_a = -1.0 * a  # beta distribution by definition has a > 0.
dist = distributions.beta(negative_a, b, strict_statistics=False)
dist.mean().eval()
```

### `class tf.contrib.distributions.DirichletMultinomial` {#DirichletMultinomial}

DirichletMultinomial mixture distribution.

This distribution is parameterized by a vector `alpha` of concentration
parameters for `k` classes and `n`, the counts per each class..

#### Mathematical details

The Dirichlet Multinomial is a distribution over k-class count data, meaning
for each k-tuple of non-negative integer `counts = [c_1,...,c_k]`, we have a
probability of these draws being made from the distribution.  The distribution
has hyperparameters `alpha = (alpha_1,...,alpha_k)`, and probability mass
function (pmf):

```pmf(counts) = N! / (n_1!...n_k!) * Beta(alpha + c) / Beta(alpha)```

where above `N = sum_j n_j`, `N!` is `N` factorial, and
`Beta(x) = prod_j Gamma(x_j) / Gamma(sum_j x_j)` is the multivariate beta
function.

This is a mixture distribution in that `M` samples can be produced by:
  1. Choose class probabilities `p = (p_1,...,p_k) ~ Dir(alpha)`
  2. Draw integers `m = (n_1,...,n_k) ~ Multinomial(N, p)`

This class provides methods to create indexed batches of Dirichlet
Multinomial distributions.  If the provided `alpha` is rank 2 or higher, for
every fixed set of leading dimensions, the last dimension represents one
single Dirichlet Multinomial distribution.  When calling distribution
functions (e.g. `dist.pmf(counts)`), `alpha` and `counts` are broadcast to the
same shape (if possible).  In all cases, the last dimension of alpha/counts
represents single Dirichlet Multinomial distributions.

#### Examples

```python
alpha = [1, 2, 3]
n = 2
dist = DirichletMultinomial(n, alpha)
```

Creates a 3-class distribution, with the 3rd class is most likely to be drawn.
The distribution functions can be evaluated on counts.

```python
# counts same shape as alpha.
counts = [0, 0, 2]
dist.pmf(counts)  # Shape []

# alpha will be broadcast to [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]] to match counts.
counts = [[1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]]
dist.pmf(counts)  # Shape [2]

# alpha will be broadcast to shape [5, 7, 3] to match counts.
counts = [[...]]  # Shape [5, 7, 3]
dist.pmf(counts)  # Shape [5, 7]
```

Creates a 2-batch of 3-class distributions.

```python
alpha = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]  # Shape [2, 3]
n = [3, 3]
dist = DirichletMultinomial(n, alpha)

# counts will be broadcast to [[2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0]] to match alpha.
counts = [2, 1, 0]
dist.pmf(counts)  # Shape [2]
```

#### `tf.contrib.distributions.DirichletMultinomial.__init__(n, alpha, allow_arbitrary_counts=False, strict=True, strict_statistics=True, name='DirichletMultinomial')` {#DirichletMultinomial.__init__}

Initialize a batch of DirichletMultinomial distributions.

##### Args:


*  <b>`n`</b>: Non-negative `float` or `double` tensor with shape
    broadcastable to `[N1,..., Nm]` with `m >= 0`.  Defines this as a batch
    of `N1 x ... x Nm` different Dirichlet multinomial distributions. Its
    components should be equal to integral values.
*  <b>`alpha`</b>: Positive `float` or `double` tensor with shape broadcastable to
    `[N1,..., Nm, k]` `m >= 0`.  Defines this as a batch of `N1 x ... x Nm`
     different `k` class Dirichlet multinomial distributions.
*  <b>`allow_arbitrary_counts`</b>: Boolean. This represents whether the pmf/cdf
    allows for the `counts` tensor to be non-integral values.
    The pmf/cdf are functions that can be evaluated at non-integral values,
    but are only a distribution over non-negative integers.  If `strict` is
    `False`, this assertion is turned off.
*  <b>`strict`</b>: Whether to assert valid values for parameters `alpha` and `n`, and
    `x` in `pmf` and `log_pmf`.  If False, correct behavior is not
    guaranteed.
*  <b>`strict_statistics`</b>: Boolean, default True.  If True, raise an exception if
    a statistic (e.g. mean/mode/etc...) is undefined for any batch member.
    If False, batch members with valid parameters leading to undefined
    statistics will return NaN for this statistic.
*  <b>`name`</b>: The name to prefix Ops created by this distribution class.


*  <b>`Examples`</b>: 

```python
# Define 1-batch of 2-class Dirichlet multinomial distribution,
# also known as a beta-binomial.

# Define a 2-batch of 3-class distributions.

### Transformed distributions

- - -

### `class tf.contrib.distributions.ContinuousTransformedDistribution` {#ContinuousTransformedDistribution}

A Transformed Distribution.

A Transformed Distribution models `p(y)` given a base distribution `p(x)`,
an invertible transform, `y = f(x)`, and the determinant of the Jacobian of
`f(x)`.

Shapes, type, and reparameterization are taken from the base distribution.

#### Mathematical details

* `p(x)` - probability distribution for random variable X
* `p(y)` - probability distribution for random variable Y
* `f` - transform
* `g` - inverse transform, `f(g(x)) = x`
* `J(x)` - Jacobian of f(x)

A Transformed Distribution exposes `sample` and `pdf`:

  * `sample`: `y = f(x)`, after drawing a sample of X.
  * `pdf`: `p(y) = p(x) / det|J(x)| = p(g(y)) / det|J(g(y))|`

distribution:

```
logit_normal = ContinuousTransformedDistribution(
  base_dist=Normal(mu, sigma),
  transform=lambda x: tf.sigmoid(x),
  inverse=lambda y: tf.log(y) - tf.log(1. - y),
  log_det_jacobian=(lambda x:
      tf.reduce_sum(tf.log(tf.sigmoid(x)) + tf.log(1. - tf.sigmoid(x)),

## Operators allowing for matrix-free methods

### Positive definite operators

A matrix is positive definite if it is symmetric with all positive eigenvalues.

- - -

### `class tf.contrib.distributions.OperatorPDBase` {#OperatorPDBase}

Class representing a (batch) of positive definite matrices `A`.

This class provides access to functions of a (batch) symmetric positive
definite (PD) matrix, without the need to materialize them.  In other words,
this provides means to do "matrix free" computations.

For example, `my_operator.matmul(x)` computes the result of matrix
multiplication, and this class is free to do this computation with or without
ever materializing a matrix.

In practice, this operator represents a (batch) matrix `A` with shape
`[N1,...,Nb, k, k]` for some `b >= 0`.  The first `b` indices index a
batch member.  For every batch index `(n1,...,nb)`, `A[n1,...,nb, : :]` is
a `k x k` matrix.  Again, this matrix `A` may not be materialized, but for
purposes of broadcasting this shape will be relevant.

Since `A` is (batch) positive definite, it has a (or several) square roots `S`
such that `A = SS^T`.

For example, if `MyOperator` inherits from `OperatorPDBase`, the user can do

```python
operator = MyOperator(...)  # Initialize with some tensors.
operator.log_det()

# Compute the quadratic form x^T A^{-1} x for vector x.
x = ... # some shape [..., k] tensor
operator.inv_quadratic_form(x)

# Matrix multiplication by the square root, S w.
# If w is iid normal, S w has covariance A.
w = ... # some shape [..., k, L] tensor, L >= 1
operator.sqrt_matmul(w)
```

The above three methods, `log_det`, `inv_quadratic_form`, and
`sqrt_matmul` provide "all" that is necessary to use a covariance matrix
in a multi-variate normal distribution.  See the class `MVNOperatorPD`.
- - -

#### `tf.contrib.distributions.OperatorPDBase.batch_shape(name='batch_shape')` {#OperatorPDBase.batch_shape}

Shape of batches associated with this operator.

If this operator represents the batch matrix `A` with
`A.shape = [N1,...,Nb, k, k]`, the `batch_shape` is `[N1,...,Nb]`.

*  <b>`name`</b>: A name scope to use for ops added by this method.

##### Returns:

  `int32` `Tensor`


- - -

#### `tf.contrib.distributions.OperatorPDBase.det(name='det')` {#OperatorPDBase.det}

### `class tf.contrib.distributions.OperatorPDFull` {#OperatorPDFull}

Class representing a (batch) of positive definite matrices `A`.

This class provides access to functions of a batch of symmetric positive
definite (PD) matrices `A` in `R^{k x k}` defined by dense matrices.
Determinants and solves are `O(k^3)`.

In practice, this operator represents a (batch) matrix `A` with shape
`[N1,...,Nb, k, k]` for some `b >= 0`.  The first `b` indices designate a
batch member.  For every batch member `(n1,...,nb)`, `A[n1,...,nb, : :]` is
a `k x k` matrix.

Since `A` is (batch) positive definite, it has a (or several) square roots `S`
such that `A = SS^T`.

For example,

```python
distributions = tf.contrib.distributions
matrix = [[1.0, 0.5], [1.0, 2.0]]
operator = OperatorPDFull(matrix)
operator.log_det()

# Compute the quadratic form x^T A^{-1} x for vector x.
x = [1.0, 2.0]
operator.inv_quadratic_form(x)

# Matrix multiplication by the square root, S w.
# If w is iid normal, S w has covariance A.
w = [[1.0], [2.0]]
operator.sqrt_matmul(w)
```

The above three methods, `log_det`, `inv_quadratic_form`, and
`sqrt_matmul` provide "all" that is necessary to use a covariance matrix
in a multi-variate normal distribution.  See the class `MVNOperatorPD`.

### `class tf.contrib.distributions.OperatorPDCholesky` {#OperatorPDCholesky}

Class representing a (batch) of positive definite matrices `A`.

This class provides access to functions of a batch of symmetric positive
definite (PD) matrices `A` in `R^{k x k}` defined by Cholesky factor(s).
Determinants and solves are `O(k^2)`.

In practice, this operator represents a (batch) matrix `A` with shape
`[N1,...,Nb, k, k]` for some `b >= 0`.  The first `b` indices designate a
batch member.  For every batch member `(n1,...,nb)`, `A[n1,...,nb, : :]` is
a `k x k` matrix.

Since `A` is (batch) positive definite, it has a (or several) square roots `S`
such that `A = SS^T`.

For example,

```python
distributions = tf.contrib.distributions
chol = [[1.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0]]
operator = OperatorPDCholesky(chol)
operator.log_det()

# Compute the quadratic form x^T A^{-1} x for vector x.
x = [1.0, 2.0]
operator.inv_quadratic_form(x)

# Matrix multiplication by the square root, S w.
# If w is iid normal, S w has covariance A.
w = [[1.0], [2.0]]
operator.sqrt_matmul(w)
```

The above three methods, `log_det`, `inv_quadratic_form`, and
`sqrt_matmul` provide "all" that is necessary to use a covariance matrix
in a multi-variate normal distribution.  See the class `MVNOperatorPD`.

### `tf.contrib.distributions.kl(dist_a, dist_b, allow_nan=False, name=None)` {#kl}

Get the KL-divergence KL(dist_a || dist_b).

##### Args:


*  <b>`dist_a`</b>: instance of distributions.BaseDistribution.
*  <b>`dist_b`</b>: instance of distributions.BaseDistribution.
*  <b>`allow_nan`</b>: If False (default), a runtime error is raised
    if the KL returns NaN values for any batch entry of the given
    distributions.  If True, the KL may return a NaN for the given entry.
*  <b>`name`</b>: (optional) Name scope to use for created operations.

##### Returns:

  A Tensor with the batchwise KL-divergence between dist_a and dist_b.

##### Raises:


*  <b>`TypeError`</b>: If dist_a or dist_b is not an instance of BaseDistribution.
*  <b>`NotImplementedError`</b>: If no KL method is defined for distribution types
    of dist_a and dist_b.

### `class tf.contrib.distributions.RegisterKL` {#RegisterKL}

Decorator to register a KL divergence implementation function.

Usage:

@distributions.RegisterKL(distributions.Normal, distributions.Normal)
def _kl_normal_mvn(norm_a, norm_b):
  # Return KL(norm_a || norm_b)

#### `tf.contrib.distributions.RegisterKL.__init__(dist_cls_a, dist_cls_b)` {#RegisterKL.__init__}

Initialize the KL registrar.

##### Args:


*  <b>`dist_cls_a`</b>: the class of the first argument of the KL divergence.
*  <b>`dist_cls_b`</b>: the class of the second argument of the KL divergence.

##### Raises:


*  <b>`TypeError`</b>: if dist_cls_a or dist_cls_b are not subclasses of
    BaseDistribution.
