# API Documentation

TensorFlow has APIs available in several languages both for constructing and
executing a TensorFlow graph. The Python API is at present the most complete and
the easiest to use, but the C++ API may offer some performance advantages in
graph execution, and supports deployment to small devices such as Android.

Additionally, the TensorFlow maintainers intend to include APIs for
[Java](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/5). We hope that
the TensorFlow community will develop front ends for other languages like
JavaScript, Lua, R and perhaps others, building on the [approach recommended by
the TensorFlow maintainers](../how_tos/language_bindings/index.md).

Note: Many practical aspects of usage are covered in the TUTORIALS and HOW TO
tab, and some additional documentation not specific to any particular language
API is available in the RESOURCES tab.
