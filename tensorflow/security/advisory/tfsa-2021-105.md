## TFSA-2021-105: Crash in `tf.transpose` with complex inputs

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29618

### Impact
Passing a complex argument to `tf.transpose` at the same time as passing
`conjugate=True` argument results in a crash:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.transpose(conjugate=True, a=complex(1))
```

### Patches
We have received a patch for the issue in GitHub commit
[1dc6a7ce6e0b3e27a7ae650bfc05b195ca793f88](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1dc6a7ce6e0b3e27a7ae650bfc05b195ca793f88).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
