## TFSA-2021-094: Heap OOB read in TFLite

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29606

### Impact
A specially crafted TFLite model could trigger an OOB read on heap in the
TFLite implementation of
[`Split_V`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c59c37e7b2d563967da813fa50fe20b21f4da683/tensorflow/lite/kernels/split_v.cc#L99):

```cc
const int input_size = SizeOfDimension(input, axis_value);
```

If `axis_value` is not a value between 0 and `NumDimensions(input)`, then the
[`SizeOfDimension`
function](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/102b211d892f3abc14f845a72047809b39cc65ab/tensorflow/lite/kernels/kernel_util.h#L148-L150)
will access data outside the bounds of the tensor shape array:

```cc
inline int SizeOfDimension(const TfLiteTensor* t, int dim) {
  return t->dims->data[dim];
}
```

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[ae2daeb45abfe2c6dda539cf8d0d6f653d3ef412](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ae2daeb45abfe2c6dda539cf8d0d6f653d3ef412).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
