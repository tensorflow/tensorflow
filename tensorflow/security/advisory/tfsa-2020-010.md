## TFSA-2020-010: Incomplete validation in TensorFlow's SavedModel's constant nodes causes segfaults

### CVE Number
CVE-2020-15206

### Impact
Changing the TensorFlow's `SavedModel` protocol buffer and altering the name of
required keys results in segfaults and data corruption while loading the model.
This can cause a denial of service in products using `tensorflow-serving` or
other inference-as-a-service installments.

We have added fixes to this in
[f760f88b4267d981e13f4b302c437ae800445968](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f760f88b4267d981e13f4b302c437ae800445968)
and
[fcfef195637c6e365577829c4d67681695956e7d](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/fcfef195637c6e365577829c4d67681695956e7d)
(both going into TensorFlow 2.2.0 and 2.3.0 but not yet backported to earlier
versions). However, this was not enough, as #41097 reports a different failure
mode.

### Vulnerable Versions
TensorFlow 1.15.0, 1.15.1, 1.15.2, 1.15.3, 2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.1.0, 2.1.1,
2.2.0, 2.3.0.

### Patches
We have patched the issue in
[adf095206f25471e864a8e63a0f1caef53a0e3a6](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/adf095206f25471e864a8e63a0f1caef53a0e3a6)
and will release patch releases for all versions between 1.15 and 2.3. Patch
releases for versions between 1.15 and 2.1 will also contain cherry-picks of
[f760f88b4267d981e13f4b302c437ae800445968](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f760f88b4267d981e13f4b302c437ae800445968)
and
[fcfef195637c6e365577829c4d67681695956e7d](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/fcfef195637c6e365577829c4d67681695956e7d).

We recommend users to upgrade to TensorFlow 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or
2.3.1.
