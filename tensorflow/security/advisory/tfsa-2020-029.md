## TFSA-2020-029: Uninitialized memory access in Eigen types

### CVE Number
CVE-2020-26266

### Impact
Under certain cases, a saved model can trigger use of uninitialized values
during code execution. This is caused by having tensor buffers be filled with
the default value of the type but forgetting to [default initialize the
quantized floating point types in
Eigen](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f70160322a579144950dff1537dcbe3c7c09d6f5/third_party/eigen3/unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/src/FixedPoint/FixedPointTypes.h#L61-L104):

```cc
struct QUInt8 {
  QUInt8() {}
  // ...
  uint8_t value;
};

struct QInt16 {
  QInt16() {}
  // ...
  int16_t value;
};

struct QUInt16 {
  QUInt16() {}
  // ...
  uint16_t value;
};

struct QInt32 {
  QInt32() {}
  // ...
  int32_t value;
};
```

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[ace0c15a22f7f054abcc1f53eabbcb0a1239a9e2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ace0c15a22f7f054abcc1f53eabbcb0a1239a9e2)
and will release TensorFlow 2.4.0 containing the patch. TensorFlow nightly
packages after this commit will also have the issue resolved.

Since this issue also impacts TF versions before 2.4, we will patch all releases
between 1.15 and 2.3 inclusive.
