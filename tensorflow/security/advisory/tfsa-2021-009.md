## TFSA-2021-009: Segfault in `SparseCountSparseOutput`

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29521

### Impact
Specifying a negative dense shape in `tf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput`
results in a segmentation fault being thrown out from the standard library as
`std::vector` invariants are broken.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

indices = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0], dtype=tf.int64)
values = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0], dtype=tf.int64)
dense_shape = tf.constant([-100, -100, -100], shape=[3], dtype=tf.int64)
weights = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0], dtype=tf.int64)

tf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput(indices=indices, values=values, dense_shape=dense_shape, weights=weights, minlength=79, maxlength=96, binary_output=False)
```

This is because the
[implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8f7b60ee8c0206a2c99802e3a4d1bb55d2bc0624/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L199-L213)
assumes the first element of the dense shape is always positive and uses it to
initialize a `BatchedMap<T>` (i.e.,
[`std::vector<absl::flat_hash_map<int64,T>>`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8f7b60ee8c0206a2c99802e3a4d1bb55d2bc0624/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L27))
data structure.

```cc
  bool is_1d = shape.NumElements() == 1;
  int num_batches = is_1d ? 1 : shape.flat<int64>()(0);
  ...
  auto per_batch_counts = BatchedMap<W>(num_batches);
```

If the `shape` tensor has more than one element, `num_batches` is the first
value in `shape`.

Ensuring that the `dense_shape` argument is a valid tensor shape (that is, all
elements are non-negative) solves this issue.

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[c57c0b9f3a4f8684f3489dd9a9ec627ad8b599f5](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c57c0b9f3a4f8684f3489dd9a9ec627ad8b599f5).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3.
