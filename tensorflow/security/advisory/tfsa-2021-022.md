## TFSA-2021-022: `CHECK`-fail in `DrawBoundingBoxes`

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29533

### Impact
An attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK` failure by passing an
empty image to `tf.raw_ops.DrawBoundingBoxes`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

images = tf.fill([53, 0, 48, 1], 0.)
boxes = tf.fill([53, 31, 4], 0.)
boxes = tf.Variable(boxes)
boxes[0, 0, 0].assign(3.90621)
tf.raw_ops.DrawBoundingBoxes(images=images, boxes=boxes)
```

This is because the
[implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/ea34a18dc3f5c8d80a40ccca1404f343b5d55f91/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/draw_bounding_box_op.cc#L148-L165)
uses `CHECK_*` assertions instead of `OP_REQUIRES` to validate user controlled
inputs. Whereas `OP_REQUIRES` allows returning an error condition back to the
user, the `CHECK_*` macros result in a crash if the condition is false, similar
to `assert`.

```cc
const int64 max_box_row_clamp = std::min<int64>(max_box_row, height - 1);
...
CHECK_GE(max_box_row_clamp, 0);
```

In this case, `height` is 0 from the `images` input. This results in
`max_box_row_clamp` being negative and the assertion being falsified, followed
by aborting program execution.

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[b432a38fe0e1b4b904a6c222cbce794c39703e87](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b432a38fe0e1b4b904a6c222cbce794c39703e87).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
