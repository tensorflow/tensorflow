## TFSA-2021-107: Segfault in `tf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput`

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29619

### Impact
Passing invalid arguments (e.g., discovered via fuzzing) to
`tf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput` results in segfault.

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[82e6203221865de4008445b13c69b6826d2b28d9](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/82e6203221865de4008445b13c69b6826d2b28d9).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
