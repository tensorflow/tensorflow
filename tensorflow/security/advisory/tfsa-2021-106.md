### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29617

### Impact
An attacker can cause a denial of service via `CHECK`-fail in
`tf.strings.substr` with invalid arguments:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.strings.substr(input='abc', len=1, pos=[1,-1])
```

```python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.strings.substr(input='abc', len=1, pos=[1,2])
```

### Patches
We have received a patch for the issue in GitHub commit
[890f7164b70354c57d40eda52dcdd7658677c09f](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/890f7164b70354c57d40eda52dcdd7658677c09f).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
