## TFSA-2021-002: Heap out of bounds write in `RaggedBinCount`

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29514

### Impact
If the `splits` argument of `RaggedBincount` does not specify a valid
[`SparseTensor`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/sparse/SparseTensor),
then an attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.raw_ops.RaggedBincount(splits=[7,8], values= [5, 16, 51, 76, 29, 27, 54, 95],\
                          size= 59, weights= [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\
                          binary_output=False)
```

This will cause a read from outside the bounds of the `splits` tensor buffer in
the [implementation of the `RaggedBincount`
op](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8b677d79167799f71c42fd3fa074476e0295413a/tensorflow/core/kernels/bincount_op.cc#L430-L446):

```cc
    for (int idx = 0; idx < num_values; ++idx) {
      while (idx >= splits(batch_idx)) {
        batch_idx++;
      }
      ...
      if (bin < size) {
        if (binary_output_) {
          out(batch_idx - 1, bin) = T(1);
        } else {
          T value = (weights_size > 0) ? weights(idx) : T(1);
          out(batch_idx - 1, bin) += value;
        }
      }
    }
```

Before the `for` loop, `batch_idx` is set to 0. The attacker sets `splits(0)` to
be 7, hence the `while` loop does not execute and `batch_idx` remains 0. This
then results in writing to `out(-1, bin)`, which is before the heap allocated
buffer for the output tensor.

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[eebb96c2830d48597d055d247c0e9aebaea94cd5](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/eebb96c2830d48597d055d247c0e9aebaea94cd5).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are also affected.
