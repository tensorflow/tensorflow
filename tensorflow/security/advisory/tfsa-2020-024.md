## TFSA-2020-024: Memory leak in `dlpack.to_dlpack`

### CVE Number
CVE-2020-15192

### Impact
If a user passes a list of strings to `dlpack.to_dlpack` there is a memory leak
following an expected [validation failure](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/c/eager/dlpack.cc#L100-L104):
```cc
      status->status = tensorflow::errors::InvalidArgument(
          DataType_Name(static_cast<DataType>(data_type)),
          " is not supported by dlpack");
```

The allocated memory is
[from](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/c/eager/dlpack.cc#L256):
```cc
  auto* tf_dlm_tensor_ctx = new TfDlManagedTensorCtx(tensor_ref);
```

The issue occurs because the `status` argument during validation failures [is not
properly checked](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/c/eager/dlpack.cc#L265-L267):
```cc
  dlm_tensor->dl_tensor.data = TFE_TensorHandleDevicePointer(h, status);
  dlm_tensor->dl_tensor.dtype = GetDlDataType(data_type, status);
```

Since each of the above methods can return an error status, the `status` value
must be checked before continuing.
