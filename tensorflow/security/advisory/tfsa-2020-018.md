## TFSA-2020-018: Heap buffer overflow due to invalid indices in SparseCountSparseOutput

### CVE Number
CVE-2020-15198

### Impact
The `SparseCountSparseOutput` implementation does not validate that the input
arguments form a valid sparse tensor. In particular, there is no validation that
the `indices` tensor has the same shape as the `values` one. The values in these
tensors are always [accessed in
parallel](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L193-L195):
```cc
    for (int idx = 0; idx < num_values; ++idx) {
      int batch = is_1d ? 0 : indices_values(idx, 0);
      const auto& value = values_values(idx);
      // ...
    }
```

Thus, a shape mismatch can result in accesses outside the bounds of heap
allocated buffers.

### Vulnerable Versions
TensorFlow 2.3.0.

### Patches
