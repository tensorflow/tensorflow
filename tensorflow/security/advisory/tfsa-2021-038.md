## TFSA-2021-038: Division by 0 in `FractionalAvgPool`

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29550

### Impact
An attacker can cause a runtime division by zero error and denial of service in
`tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPool`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

value = tf.constant([60], shape=[1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=tf.int32)
pooling_ratio = [1.0, 1.0000014345305555, 1.0, 1.0]
pseudo_random = False
overlapping = False
deterministic = False
seed = 0
seed2 = 0

tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPool(
  value=value, pooling_ratio=pooling_ratio, pseudo_random=pseudo_random,
  overlapping=overlapping, deterministic=deterministic, seed=seed, seed2=seed2)
```

This is because the
[implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L85-L89)
computes a divisor quantity by dividing two user controlled values:

```cc
for (int i = 0; i < tensor_in_and_out_dims; ++i) {
  output_size[i] = static_cast<int>(std::floor(input_size[i] / pooling_ratio_[i]));
  DCHECK_GT(output_size[i], 0);
}
```

The user controls the values of `input_size[i]` and `pooling_ratio_[i]` (via the
`value.shape()` and `pooling_ratio` arguments). If the value in `input_size[i]`
is smaller than the `pooling_ratio_[i]`, then the floor operation results in
`output_size[i]` being 0. The `DCHECK_GT` line is a no-op outside of debug mode,
so in released versions of TF this does not trigger.

Later, these computed values [are used as
arguments](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L96-L99)
to
[`GeneratePoolingSequence`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_pool_common.cc#L100-L108).
There, the first computation is a division in a modulo operation:

```cc
std::vector<int64> GeneratePoolingSequence(int input_length, int output_length,
                                           GuardedPhiloxRandom* generator,
                                           bool pseudo_random) {
  ...
  if (input_length % output_length == 0) {
    diff = std::vector<int64>(output_length, input_length / output_length);
  }
  ...
}
```

Since `output_length` can be 0, this results in runtime crashing.

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[548b5eaf23685d86f722233d8fbc21d0a4aecb96](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/548b5eaf23685d86f722233d8fbc21d0a4aecb96).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
