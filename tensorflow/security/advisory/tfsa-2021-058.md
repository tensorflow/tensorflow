## TFSA-2021-058: Heap out of bounds read in `RequantizationRange`

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29569

### Impact
The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` can cause reads outside
of bounds of heap allocated data if attacker supplies specially crafted inputs:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

input = tf.constant([1], shape=[1], dtype=tf.qint32)
input_max = tf.constant([], dtype=tf.float32)
input_min = tf.constant([], dtype=tf.float32)

tf.raw_ops.RequantizationRange(input=input, input_min=input_min, input_max=input_max)
```

The
[implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/ac328eaa3870491ababc147822cd04e91a790643/tensorflow/core/kernels/requantization_range_op.cc#L49-L50)
assumes that the `input_min` and `input_max` tensors have at least one element,
as it accesses the first element in two arrays:

```cc
const float input_min_float = ctx->input(1).flat<float>()(0);
const float input_max_float = ctx->input(2).flat<float>()(0);
```

If the tensors are empty, `.flat<T>()` is an empty object, backed by an empty
array. Hence, accesing even the 0th element is a read outside the bounds.

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[ef0c008ee84bad91ec6725ddc42091e19a30cf0e](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ef0c008ee84bad91ec6725ddc42091e19a30cf0e).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
