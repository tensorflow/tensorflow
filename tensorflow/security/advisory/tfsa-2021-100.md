## TFSA-2021-100: Heap buffer overflow in `BandedTriangularSolve`

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29612

### Impact
An attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow in Eigen implementation of
`tf.raw_ops.BandedTriangularSolve`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

matrix_array = np.array([])
matrix_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(np.reshape(matrix_array,(0,1)),dtype=tf.float32)
rhs_array = np.array([1,1])
rhs_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(np.reshape(rhs_array,(1,2)),dtype=tf.float32)
tf.raw_ops.BandedTriangularSolve(matrix=matrix_tensor,rhs=rhs_tensor)
```

The
[implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/banded_triangular_solve_op.cc#L269-L278)
calls `ValidateInputTensors` for input validation but fails to validate that the
two tensors are not empty:

```cc
void ValidateInputTensors(OpKernelContext* ctx, const Tensor& in0, const Tensor& in1) {
  OP_REQUIRES(
      ctx, in0.dims() >= 2,
      errors::InvalidArgument("In[0] ndims must be >= 2: ", in0.dims()));

  OP_REQUIRES(
      ctx, in1.dims() >= 2,
      errors::InvalidArgument("In[1] ndims must be >= 2: ", in1.dims()));
}
```

Furthermore, since `OP_REQUIRES` macro only stops execution of current function
after setting `ctx->status()` to a non-OK value, callers of helper functions
that use `OP_REQUIRES` must check value of `ctx->status()` before continuing.
This doesn't happen [in this op's
implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/banded_triangular_solve_op.cc#L219),
hence the validation that is present is also not effective.

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[ba6822bd7b7324ba201a28b2f278c29a98edbef2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ba6822bd7b7324ba201a28b2f278c29a98edbef2)
followed by GitHub commit
[0ab290774f91a23bebe30a358fde4e53ab4876a0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/0ab290774f91a23bebe30a358fde4e53ab4876a0).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
