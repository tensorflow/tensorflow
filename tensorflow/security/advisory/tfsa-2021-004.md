## TFSA-2021-004: Reference binding to null pointer in `MatrixDiag*` ops

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29515

### Impact
The implementation of [`MatrixDiag*`
operations](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/4c4f420e68f1cfaf8f4b6e8e3eb857e9e4c3ff33/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/matrix_diag_op.cc#L195-L197)
does not validate that the tensor arguments are non-empty:

```cc
      num_rows = context->input(2).flat<int32>()(0);
      num_cols = context->input(3).flat<int32>()(0);
      padding_value = context->input(4).flat<T>()(0);
```

Thus, users can trigger null pointer dereferences if any of the above tensors
are null:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

d = tf.convert_to_tensor([],dtype=tf.float32)
p = tf.convert_to_tensor([],dtype=tf.float32)
tf.raw_ops.MatrixDiagV2(diagonal=d, k=0, num_rows=0, num_cols=0, padding_value=p)
```

Changing from `tf.raw_ops.MatrixDiagV2` to `tf.raw_ops.MatrixDiagV3` still reproduces the issue.

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[a7116dd3913c4a4afd2a3a938573aa7c785fdfc6](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a7116dd3913c4a4afd2a3a938573aa7c785fdfc6).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
