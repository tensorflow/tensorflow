## TFSA-2020-032: Heap out of bounds read in filesystem glob matching

### CVE Number
CVE-2020-26269

### Impact
The general implementation for matching filesystem paths to globbing pattern is
vulnerable to an access out of bounds of [the array holding the
directories](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/458c6260265c46ebaf18052d6c61aea4b6b40926/tensorflow/core/platform/file_system_helper.cc#L127):

```cc
if (!fs->Match(child_path, dirs[dir_index])) { ... }
```

Since `dir_index` is [unconditionaly
incremented](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/458c6260265c46ebaf18052d6c61aea4b6b40926/tensorflow/core/platform/file_system_helper.cc#L106)
outside of the lambda function where the vulnerable pattern occurs, this results
in an access out of bounds issue under certain scenarios. For example, if
`/tmp/x` is a directory that only contains a single file `y`, then the following
snippet will cause a crash due to the out of bounds read:

```python
>>> tf.io.gfile.glob('/tmp/x/')
Segmentation fault
```

There are multiple invariants and preconditions that are assumed by the parallel
implementation of `GetMatchingPaths` but are not verified by the PRs introducing
it ([#40861](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/40861) and
[#44310](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/44310)). Thus, we are
completely rewriting the implementation to fully specify and validate these.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[8b5b9dc96666a3a5d27fad7179ff215e3b74b67c](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8b5b9dc96666a3a5d27fad7179ff215e3b74b67c)
and will release TensorFlow 2.4.0 containing the patch. TensorFlow nightly
packages after this commit will also have the issue resolved.

This issue only impacts master branch and the release candidates for TF version
2.4. The final release of the 2.4 release will be patched.
