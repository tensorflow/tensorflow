## TFSA-2020-028: Float cast overflow undefined behavior

### CVE Number
CVE-2020-15266

### Impact
When the `boxes` argument of `tf.image.crop_and_resize` has a very large value,
the CPU kernel implementation receives it as a C++ `nan` floating point value.
Attempting to operate on this is undefined behavior which later produces a
segmentation fault.
