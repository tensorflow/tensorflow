## TFSA-2021-082: Division by zero in TFLite's convolution code

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29594

### Impact
TFLite's [convolution
code](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/09c73bca7d648e961dd05898292d91a8322a9d45/tensorflow/lite/kernels/conv.cc)
has multiple division where the divisor is controlled by the user and not
checked to be non-zero. For example:

```cc
const int input_size = NumElements(input) / SizeOfDimension(input, 0);
```

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[ff489d95a9006be080ad14feb378f2b4dac35552](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ff489d95a9006be080ad14feb378f2b4dac35552).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
