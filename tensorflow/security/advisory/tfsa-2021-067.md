## TFSA-2021-067: Heap buffer overflow in `FractionalAvgPoolGrad`

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-29578

### Impact
The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad` is vulnerable to a heap
buffer overflow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

orig_input_tensor_shape = tf.constant([1, 3, 2, 3], shape=[4], dtype=tf.int64)
out_backprop = tf.constant([2], shape=[1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=tf.int64)
row_pooling_sequence = tf.constant([1], shape=[1], dtype=tf.int64)
col_pooling_sequence = tf.constant([1], shape=[1], dtype=tf.int64)


tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad(
  orig_input_tensor_shape=orig_input_tensor_shape, out_backprop=out_backprop,
  row_pooling_sequence=row_pooling_sequence,
  col_pooling_sequence=col_pooling_sequence, overlapping=False)
```

The
[implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/dcba796a28364d6d7f003f6fe733d82726dda713/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L216)
fails to validate that the pooling sequence arguments have enough elements as
required by the `out_backprop` tensor shape.

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[12c727cee857fa19be717f336943d95fca4ffe4f](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/12c727cee857fa19be717f336943d95fca4ffe4f).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
