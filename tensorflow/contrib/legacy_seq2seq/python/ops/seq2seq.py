"""Library for creating sequence-to-sequence models in TensorFlow.

Sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural networks can learn complex functions
that map input sequences to output sequences. These models yield very good
results on a number of tasks, such as speech recognition, parsing, machine
translation, or even constructing automated replies to emails.

Before using this module, it is recommended to read the TensorFlow tutorial
on sequence-to-sequence models. It explains the basic concepts of this module
and shows an end-to-end example of how to build a translation model.
  https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/tutorials/seq2seq/index.html

Here is an overview of functions available in this module. They all use
a very similar interface, so after reading the above tutorial and using
one of them, others should be easy to substitute.

* Full sequence-to-sequence models.
  - basic_rnn_seq2seq: The most basic RNN-RNN model.
  - tied_rnn_seq2seq: The basic model with tied encoder and decoder weights.
  - embedding_rnn_seq2seq: The basic model with input embedding.
  - embedding_tied_rnn_seq2seq: The tied model with input embedding.
  - embedding_attention_seq2seq: Advanced model with input embedding and
      the neural attention mechanism; recommended for complex tasks.

* Multi-task sequence-to-sequence models.
  - one2many_rnn_seq2seq: The embedding model with multiple decoders.

* Decoders (when you write your own encoder, you can use these to decode;
    e.g., if you want to write a model that generates captions for images).
  - rnn_decoder: The basic decoder based on a pure RNN.
  - attention_decoder: A decoder that uses the attention mechanism.

* Losses.
  - sequence_loss: Loss for a sequence model returning average log-perplexity.
  - sequence_loss_by_example: As above, but not averaging over all examples.

* model_with_buckets: A convenience function to create models with bucketing
    (see the tutorial above for an explanation of why and how to use it).

  """RNN decoder with attention for the sequence-to-sequence model.

  In this context "attention" means that, during decoding, the RNN can look up
  information in the additional tensor attention_states, and it does this by
  focusing on a few entries from the tensor. This model has proven to yield
  especially good results in a number of sequence-to-sequence tasks. This
  implementation is based on http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7449 (see below for
  details). It is recommended for complex sequence-to-sequence tasks.

  Args:
    decoder_inputs: A list of 2D Tensors [batch_size x input_size].
    initial_state: 2D Tensor [batch_size x cell.state_size].
    attention_states: 3D Tensor [batch_size x attn_length x attn_size].
    cell: rnn_cell.RNNCell defining the cell function and size.
    output_size: Size of the output vectors; if None, we use cell.output_size.
    num_heads: Number of attention heads that read from attention_states.
    loop_function: If not None, this function will be applied to i-th output
      in order to generate i+1-th input, and decoder_inputs will be ignored,
      except for the first element ("GO" symbol). This can be used for decoding,
      but also for training to emulate http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03099.
      Signature -- loop_function(prev, i) = next
        * prev is a 2D Tensor of shape [batch_size x output_size],
        * i is an integer, the step number (when advanced control is needed),
        * next is a 2D Tensor of shape [batch_size x input_size].
    dtype: The dtype to use for the RNN initial state (default: tf.float32).
    scope: VariableScope for the created subgraph; default: "attention_decoder".
    initial_state_attention: If False (default), initial attentions are zero.
      If True, initialize the attentions from the initial state and attention
      states -- useful when we wish to resume decoding from a previously
      stored decoder state and attention states.

  Returns:
    A tuple of the form (outputs, state), where:
      outputs: A list of the same length as decoder_inputs of 2D Tensors of
        shape [batch_size x output_size]. These represent the generated outputs.
        Output i is computed from input i (which is either the i-th element
        of decoder_inputs or loop_function(output {i-1}, i)) as follows.
        First, we run the cell on a combination of the input and previous
        attention masks:
          cell_output, new_state = cell(linear(input, prev_attn), prev_state).
        Then, we calculate new attention masks:
          new_attn = softmax(V^T * tanh(W * attention_states + U * new_state))
        and then we calculate the output:
          output = linear(cell_output, new_attn).
      state: The state of each decoder cell the final time-step.
        It is a 2D Tensor of shape [batch_size x cell.state_size].
