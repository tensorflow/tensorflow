# RUN
Run with grpc+seastar:
Use grpc+seastar you have to create .endpoint_map file in launch dir.
(42353 and 42354 are grpc ports, 46068 and 47079 are seastar ports)
127.0.0.1:42353=127.0.0.1:46068

# Seastar-based RPC for TF Worker Service

## User API
To use it in low level API, specify protocol=grpc+seastar in tf.train.Server.
To use it in TF 2.0 higher API, specify rpc_layer=grpc+seastar in distribution
strategy or TF_CONFIG environment variable. 

## Design Goal
The grpc+seastar RPC protocol is designed to improve the performance of
distributed sparse model training, typically with hundreds or more worker
nodes and large-scale embedding variables in the model. In particular, the
protocol is proposed to address two performance bottlenecks induced by gRPC:
(1) low QPS for small RPC message (2) extra copying of large RPC message.

Some of the existing networking plugins (such as grpc+verbs) could partially
address the second bottleneck, but they do not resolve the first one, which
is the main obstacle for us to scale when our parameter synchronization
process occurs, once a couple of milliseconds with hundreds of nodes.

## Architecture
The grpc+seastar RPC protocol has three components:
Seastar: an Apache 2.0 licensed high-performance server-side application
framework. It uses kernel-bypass networking and userspace networking
protocol stack to avoid frequent threading, context switching,
and memory copying.

TF2Seastar: wrapper classes of Seastar servers and clients to initialize RPC
handlers to process RPC requests and responses. Seastar itself is not an RPC
library like gRPC, so we wrap it to act like an RPC system. We also design
a zero-copy wire format so that we could avoid extra memory copy with
transmitting tensor data.

Distributed runtime: TF WorkerService stubs implemented using TF2Seastar.
Some RPC methods in WorkerServices uses the zero-copy wire format
above (such as RecvTensor and RunGraph), while others still use Protocol
Buffer. We keep the original gRPC implementation in TF MasterService stubs.
