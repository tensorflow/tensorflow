Bucketizes 'input' based on 'boundaries'.

For example, if the inputs are
    boundaries = [0, 10, 100]
    input = [[-5, 10000]
             [150,   10]
             [5,    100]]

then the output will be
    output = [[0, 3]
              [3, 2]
              [1, 3]]

input: Any shape of Tensor contains with int or float type.
boundaries: A sorted list of floats gives the boundary of the buckets.
output: Same shape with 'input', each value of input replaced with bucket index.
