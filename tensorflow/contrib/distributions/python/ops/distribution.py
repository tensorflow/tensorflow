class BaseDistribution(object):
  """Abstract base class for probability distributions.

  This class, along with `ContinuousDistribution` and `DiscreteDistribution`,
  defines the API for probability distributions.

  Users will never instantiate a `BaseDistribution`, but will instead
  instantiate subclasses of either `ContinuousDistribution` or
  `DiscreteDistribution`.

  Developers of new distributions should prefer to subclass
  `ContinuousDistribution` or `DiscreteDistribution`.

  ### API

  The key methods for probability distributions are defined here. The likelihood
  functions (`pdf`, `log_pdf`) and (`pmf`, `log_pmf`) are defined in
  `ContinuousDistribution` and `DiscreteDistribution`, respectively.

  To keep ops generated by the distribution tied together by name, subclasses
  should override `name` and use it to preprend names of ops in other methods
  (see `cdf` for an example).

  Subclasses that wish to support `cdf` and `log_cdf` can override `log_cdf`
  and use the base class's implementation for `cdf`.

  ### Broadcasting, batching, and shapes

  All distributions support batches of independent distributions of that type.
  The batch shape is determined by broadcasting together the parameters.

  The shape of arguments to `__init__`, `cdf`, `log_cdf`, and the likelihood
  functions defined in `ContinuousDistribution` and `DiscreteDistribution`
  reflect this broadcasting, as does the return value of `sample`.

  `sample_shape = (n,) + batch_shape + event_shape`, where `sample_shape` is the
  shape of the `Tensor` returned from `sample`, `n` is the number of samples,
  `batch_shape` defines how many independent distributions there are, and
  `event_shape` defines the shape of samples from each of those independent
  distributions. Samples are independent along the `batch_shape` dimensions,
  but not necessarily so along the `event_shape` dimensions (dependending on
  the particulars of the underlying distribution).

  Using the `Uniform` distribution as an example:

  ```python
  minval = 3.0
  maxval = [[4.0, 6.0],
            [10.0, 12.0]]

  # Broadcasting:
  # This instance represents 4 Uniform distributions. Each has a lower bound at
  # 3.0 as the `minval` parameter was broadcasted to match `maxval`'s shape.
  u = Uniform(minval, maxval)

  # `event_shape` is `TensorShape([])`.
  event_shape = u.get_event_shape()
  # `event_shape_t` is a `Tensor` which will evaluate to a scalar 1.
  event_shape_t = u.event_shape

  # Sampling returns a sample per distribution.  `samples` has shape
  # (5, 2, 2), which is (n,) + batch_shape + event_shape, where n=5,
  # batch_shape=(2, 2), and event_shape=().
  samples = u.sample(5)

  # The broadcasting holds across methods. Here we use `cdf` as an example. The
  # same holds for `log_cdf` and the likelihood functions.

  # `cum_prob` has shape (2, 2) as the `value` argument was broadcasted to the
  # shape of the `Uniform` instance.
  cum_prob_broadcast = u.cdf(4.0)

  # `cum_prob`'s shape is (2, 2), one per distribution. No broadcasting
  # occurred.
  cum_prob_per_dist = u.cdf([[4.0, 5.0],
                             [6.0, 7.0]])

  # INVALID as the `value` argument is not broadcastable to the distribution's
  # shape.
  cum_prob_invalid = u.cdf([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])
  ```
