# Learn and use machine learning

This collection of Python notebooks is from the book
*[Deep Learning with Python](https://books.google.com/books?id=Yo3CAQAACAAJ)* and
ported to use `tf.keras`, TensorFlow's high-level API for building and training
deep learning models. For details about using Keras with TensorFlow, see the
[TensorFlow Keras Guide](../../guide/keras).

Publisher's note: *Deep Learning with Python* introduces the field of deep
learning using the Python language and the powerful Keras library. Written by
Keras creator and Google AI researcher François Chollet, this book builds your
understanding through intuitive explanations and practical examples.

To learn about machine learning fundamentals and concepts, consider taking the
[Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/).
Additional TensorFlow and machine learning resources are listed in [next steps](../next_steps).
