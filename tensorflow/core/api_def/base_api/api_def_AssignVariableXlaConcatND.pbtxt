  summary: "Concats input tensor across all dimensions."
  description: <<END
An op which merges slices the input tensor based on the given num_splits
attribute, strips paddings optionally, and writes the merged tensor without
paddings to the resource variable.

This op may be generated via the TPU bridge.

For example, with `input` tensor:
```
[[0, 1],
 [4, 5]]
[[2, 3],
 [6, 7]]
[[8, 9],
 [12, 13]]
[[10, 11],
 [14, 15]]
```
`num_splits`:
```
[2, 2]
```
and `paddings`:
```
[1, 1]
```
the expected `outputs` is:
```
[[0, 1, 2],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [8, 9, 10]]
```
END
}
