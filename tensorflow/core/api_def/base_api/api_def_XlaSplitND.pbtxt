  summary: "Splits input tensor across all dimensions."
  description: <<END
An op which slices the input tensor based on the given num_splits attribute,
pads slices optionally, and returned the slices. Slices are returned in
row-major order.

This op may be generated via the TPU bridge.

For example, with `input` tensor:
```
[[0, 1, 2],
 [3, 4, 5],
 [6, 7, 8]]
```
`num_splits`:
```
[2, 2]
```
and `paddings`:
```
[1, 1]
```
the expected `outputs` is:
```
[[0, 1],
 [3, 4]]
[[2, 0],
 [5, 0]]
[[6, 7],
 [0, 0]]
[[8, 0],
 [0, 0]]
```
END
}
