    description: <<END
Dtype of the output tensor.

Note on supported input-output type combinations:
* For floating-point types, the output has the same dtype as the input.
* For 8-bit and 16-bit integer inputs, the output is a 32-bit float.
* For 32-bit and 64-bit integer inputs, the output is a 64-bit float.

Using unsupported dtype pairs (for example, input=float64 with output=float32)
will result in a "Could not find device for node" error.
