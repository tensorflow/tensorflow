A complex64 tensor of the same rank as `input`. The inner-most 3
  dimensions of `input` are replaced with the their 3D Fourier transform. The
  inner-most dimension contains `fft_length / 2 + 1` unique frequency
  components.

Equivalent to np.fft.rfftn with 3 dimensions.

  summary: "3D real-valued fast Fourier transform."
  description: <<END
Computes the 3-dimensional discrete Fourier transform of a real-valued signal
over the inner-most 3 dimensions of `input`.

Since the DFT of a real signal is Hermitian-symmetric, `RFFT3D` only returns the
`fft_length / 2 + 1` unique components of the FFT for the inner-most dimension
of `output`: the zero-frequency term, followed by the `fft_length / 2`
positive-frequency terms.

Along each axis `RFFT3D` is computed on, if `fft_length` is smaller than the
corresponding dimension of `input`, the dimension is cropped. If it is larger,
the dimension is padded with zeros.
