  graph_op_name: "CollectiveReduceV2"
  summary: "Mutually reduces multiple tensors of identical type and shape."
  description: <<END
`is_stateless` means each op does not need control dependencies to other
collective ops. In this case, keys that are unique at runtime
(e.g. `instance_key`) should be used to distinguish collective groups.
