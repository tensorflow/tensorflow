first dimension.  Values should be sorted and can be repeated.

  description: <<END
Read @{$math_ops#segmentation$the section on segmentation} for an explanation of
segments.

Computes a tensor such that
\\(output_i = \min_j(data_j)\\) where `min` is over `j` such
that `segment_ids[j] == i`.

If the min is empty for a given segment ID `i`, `output[i] = 0`.
