  summary: "Inverse 3D real-valued fast Fourier transform."
  description: <<END
Computes the inverse 3-dimensional discrete Fourier transform of a real-valued
signal over the inner-most 3 dimensions of `input`.

The inner-most 3 dimensions of `input` are assumed to be the result of `RFFT3D`:
The inner-most dimension contains the `fft_length / 2 + 1` unique components of
the DFT of a real-valued signal. If `fft_length` is not provided, it is computed
from the size of the inner-most 3 dimensions of `input`. If the FFT length used
to compute `input` is odd, it should be provided since it cannot be inferred
properly.

Along each axis `IRFFT3D` is computed on, if `fft_length` (or
`fft_length / 2 + 1` for the inner-most dimension) is smaller than the
corresponding dimension of `input`, the dimension is cropped. If it is larger,
the dimension is padded with zeros.
