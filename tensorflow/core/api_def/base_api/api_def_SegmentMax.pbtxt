Read
[the section on segmentation](https://tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/math_ops#Segmentation)
for an explanation of segments.

Computes a tensor such that
\\(output_i = \max_j(data_j)\\) where `max` is over `j` such
that `segment_ids[j] == i`.

If the max is empty for a given segment ID `i`, `output[i] = 0`.
