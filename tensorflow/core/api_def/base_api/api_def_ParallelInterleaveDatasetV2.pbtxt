  summary: "Creates a dataset that applies `f` to the outputs of `input_dataset`."
  description: <<END
The resulting dataset is similar to the `InterleaveDataset`, except that the
dataset will fetch records from the interleaved datasets in parallel.

The `tf.data` Python API creates instances of this op from
`Dataset.interleave()` when the `num_parallel_calls` parameter of that method
is set to any value other than `None`.

By default, the output of this dataset will be deterministic, which may result
in the dataset blocking if the next data item to be returned isn't available.
In order to avoid head-of-line blocking, one can set the
`experimental_deterministic` parameter of `tf.data.Options` to `False`,
which can improve performance at the expense of non-determinism.
