  summary: "Bucketizes \'input\' based on \'boundaries\'."
  description: <<END
For example, if the inputs are
    boundaries = [0, 10, 100]
    input = [[-5, 10000]
             [150,   10]
             [5,    100]]

then the output will be
    output = [[0, 3]
              [3, 2]
              [1, 3]]
END
