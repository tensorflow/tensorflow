Read
[the section on segmentation](https://tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/math_ops#Segmentation)
for an explanation of segments.

Computes a tensor such that
\\(output[i] = sum_{j...} data[j...]\\) where the sum is over tuples `j...` such
that `segment_ids[j...] == i`.  Unlike `SegmentSum`, `segment_ids`
need not be sorted and need not cover all values in the full
range of valid values.

If the sum is empty for a given segment ID `i`, `output[i] = 0`.
If the given segment ID `i` is negative, the value is dropped and will not be
added to the sum of the segment.

`num_segments` should equal the number of distinct segment IDs.
