  summary: "Extracts a glimpse from the input tensor."
  description: <<END
Returns a set of windows called glimpses extracted at location
`offsets` from the input tensor. If the windows only partially
overlaps the inputs, the non overlapping areas will be filled with
random noise.

The result is a 4-D tensor of shape `[batch_size, glimpse_height,
glimpse_width, channels]`. The channels and batch dimensions are the
same as that of the input tensor. The height and width of the output
windows are specified in the `size` parameter.

The argument `normalized` and `centered` controls how the windows are built:

* If the coordinates are normalized but not centered, 0.0 and 1.0
  correspond to the minimum and maximum of each height and width
  dimension.
* If the coordinates are both normalized and centered, they range from
  -1.0 to 1.0. The coordinates (-1.0, -1.0) correspond to the upper
  left corner, the lower right corner is located at (1.0, 1.0) and the
  center is at (0, 0).
* If the coordinates are not normalized they are interpreted as
  numbers of pixels.
