// specified fetches (operations that return tensors) or targets (operations
// that don't return tensors) are reached. A PartialRun has two components: a
// setup which specifies all desired fetches and targets, and run calls that
// specify fetch values (from the setup calls) to retrieve.
// On the last partial run call, it is possible to satisfy the
// required fetches before the executor has completed running the graph to all
// the desired targets.
// PartialRunMgr is used to ensure that we don't complete and return the final
// partial run call to the user until both the partial run and executor have
// completed.
