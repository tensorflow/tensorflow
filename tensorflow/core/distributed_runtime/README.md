# Distributed TensorFlow

This directory contains the initial open-source implementation of the
distributed TensorFlow runtime, using [gRPC](http://grpc.io) for inter-process
communication.

To learn how to use the distributed runtime to create a TensorFlow cluster,
see the [Distributed TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/deploy/distributed) How-To.
