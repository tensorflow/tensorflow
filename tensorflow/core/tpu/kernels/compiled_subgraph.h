// Cache for compiled TPU program.
//
// Each key identifies a unique subgraph, and the value is the vector of
// protos that are emitted by compiling the subgraph.
//
// When a subgraph is considered for compilation, the client calls
//
// auto subgraph_key = <compute key for subgraph>;
// auto compile_function = <lambda to compile subgraph into protos>;
// auto per_step_ref_holder = <container to control lifetime of cached
// results>;
// int64 uid;
// std::vector<string> proto_key;
// CompileIfKeyAbsent(subgraph_key, per_step_ref_holder, &uid, &proto_key,
//                    compile_function);
//
// where subgraph_key is the key computed for the subgraph. On success,
// proto_key contains a vector of keys, where proto_key[i] can be used to look
// up the ith proto compiled from the subgraph, and uid contains an identifier
// that can be used in place of key for clients that require cheap
// serializable handles. If the compiled protos were not present in the cache,
// compile_function would be called to generate them. per_step_ref_holder
// extends the lifetime of cached results: it is guaranteed that the protos
// indicated in proto_key will be available for lookup for at least as long as
// per_step_ref_holder is not deleted.
//
// If the caller passes nullptr instead of a per_step_ref_holder then the
// caller is responsible for calling Release(subgraph_key) once for every call
// to CompileIfKeyAbsent(subgraph_key, ...) to discard the reference to the
// compilation results, after the caller is sure it will not look up the
// compiled executables again.
//
// Subsequently the client can call
//
// std::unique_ptr<CompilationCacheEntryRef> entry;
// Lookup(proto_key, &entry);
// auto proto = entry->get();
//
// or
//
// std::unique_ptr<CompilationCacheEntryRef> entry;
// Lookup(uid, proto_index, &entry);
// auto proto = entry->get();
//
// to access a cached proto.
// TODO(misard) Switch the existing TPU ops to use uid+proto_index instead of
// string keys for proto lookups.
//
//
// Usage details within the system:
//
// This cache lives in the resource manager of the TPU_SYSTEM device where the
// compiler runs, typically worker 0 of the system. The cache is discarded and
// a new one created whenever the system is reinitialized.
//
// A compiled subgraph is placed into the cache using a key that is a
// combination of the function name, guaranteed_constants, the shapes of the
// dynamic inputs to the subgraph, and the function library in use at the time
// of execution.
//
// Whenever a compile Op is run, it looks to see if there is already an entry
// in the cache corresponding to that Op and the current dynamic shapes, and
// creates one if not. The entry is marked as most recently used in the cache
// by the compile Op. The entry is reference counted. The cache owns one entry
// , and each step that has executed a compile Op referring to the entry owns
// a reference until that step completes.
//
// If the cache exceeds a configured storage limit, entries are marked for
// eviction in order of least recently used. An entry is not evicted until all
// references to it are discarded, so an entry that is marked for eviction can
// still be looked up by the execute Ops in a running step. If another Compile
// Op looks up an entry that is marked for eviction, the entry will be
// unmarked and set to most recently used.
