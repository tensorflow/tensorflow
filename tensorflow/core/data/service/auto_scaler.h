// Estimates the optimal number of tf.data service workers for an Iteration
// based on the current workload.
// Note: It is assumed that all reported times correspond to the same Iteration.
//
// Glossary:
// * Consumer: A client that consumes elements from tf.data service.
// * Worker: A tf.data service worker.
// * Processing time (PT): The estimated time it takes a worker to process and
// produce an element.
// * Target processing time (TPT): From the perspective of a consumer,
// it is the maximum time a tf.data input pipeline can take to produce an
// element such that the downstream processor wait time is 0. In other words,
// this is the ideal time the tf.data pipeline should take to produce an element
// so that training doesn't slow down due to waiting for elements. This means
// that we want processing time <= target processing time, so that when an
// element is requested, the pipeline has processed it already.
// * Worker throughput (WT): It is the multiplicative inverse of processing time
// (1 / PT). This refers to the number of elements produced by a worker per
// second.
// * Consumption rate (CR): It is the multiplicative inverse of target
// processing time (1 / TPT). This refers to the number of elements requested by
// a consumer per second.
//
// **AutoScaler overview**
//
// 1. It keeps track of the most recent worker throughputs reported by each
// worker in the data service cluster, as well as the most recent consumption
// rates reported by each consumer. WTs and CRs are derived from reporting PTs
// and TPTs, respectively.
// 2. Having this information, it estimates the optimal number of workers N as
// follows:
//  N = (Sum of CRs reported by all consumers) /
//      (Average of WTs reported by all workers)
//
// AutoScaler is thread-safe.
