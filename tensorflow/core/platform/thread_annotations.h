// This header file contains the macro definitions for thread safety
// annotations that allow the developers to document the locking policies
// of their multi-threaded code. The annotations can also help program
// analysis tools to identify potential thread safety issues.
//
// The primary documentation on these annotations is external:
// http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html
//
// The annotations are implemented using compiler attributes.
// Using the macros defined here instead of the raw attributes allows
// for portability and future compatibility.
//
// When referring to mutexes in the arguments of the attributes, you should
// use variable names or more complex expressions (e.g. my_object->mutex_)
// that evaluate to a concrete mutex object whenever possible. If the mutex
// you want to refer to is not in scope, you may use a member pointer
// (e.g. &MyClass::mutex_) to refer to a mutex in some (unknown) object.
