r"""Simple transfer learning with Inception v3 or Mobilenet models.

With support for TensorBoard.

This example shows how to take a Inception v3 or Mobilenet model trained on
ImageNet images, and train a new top layer that can recognize other classes of
images.

The top layer receives as input a 2048-dimensional vector (1001-dimensional for
Mobilenet) for each image. We train a softmax layer on top of this
representation. Assuming the softmax layer contains N labels, this corresponds
to learning N + 2048*N (or 1001*N)  model parameters corresponding to the
learned biases and weights.

Here's an example, which assumes you have a folder containing class-named
subfolders, each full of images for each label. The example folder flower_photos
should have a structure like this:

~/flower_photos/daisy/photo1.jpg
~/flower_photos/daisy/photo2.jpg
...
~/flower_photos/rose/anotherphoto77.jpg
...
~/flower_photos/sunflower/somepicture.jpg

The subfolder names are important, since they define what label is applied to
each image, but the filenames themselves don't matter. Once your images are
prepared, you can run the training with a command like this:


```bash
bazel build tensorflow/examples/image_retraining:retrain && \
bazel-bin/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain \
    --image_dir ~/flower_photos
```

Or, if you have a pip installation of tensorflow, `retrain.py` can be run
without bazel:

```bash
python tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py \
    --image_dir ~/flower_photos
```

You can replace the image_dir argument with any folder containing subfolders of
images. The label for each image is taken from the name of the subfolder it's
in.

This produces a new model file that can be loaded and run by any TensorFlow
program, for example the label_image sample code.

By default this script will use the high accuracy, but comparatively large and
slow Inception v3 model architecture. It's recommended that you start with this
to validate that you have gathered good training data, but if you want to deploy
on resource-limited platforms, you can try the `--architecture` flag with a
Mobilenet model. For example:

```bash
python tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py \
    --image_dir ~/flower_photos --architecture mobilenet_1.0_224
```

There are 32 different Mobilenet models to choose from, with a variety of file
size and latency options. The first number can be '1.0', '0.75', '0.50', or
'0.25' to control the size, and the second controls the input image size, either
'224', '192', '160', or '128', with smaller sizes running faster. See
https://research.googleblog.com/2017/06/mobilenets-open-source-models-for.html
for more information on Mobilenet.

To use with TensorBoard:

By default, this script will log summaries to /tmp/retrain_logs directory

Visualize the summaries with this command:

tensorboard --logdir /tmp/retrain_logs

  Cropping
  ~~~~~~~~

  Cropping is done by placing a bounding box at a random position in the full
  image. The cropping parameter controls the size of that box relative to the
  input image. If it's zero, then the box is the same size as the input and no
  cropping is performed. If the value is 50%, then the crop box will be half the
  width and height of the input. In a diagram it looks like this:

  <       width         >
  +---------------------+
  |                     |
  |   width - crop%     |

  |                     |
  +---------------------+

  Scaling
  ~~~~~~~

  Scaling is a lot like cropping, except that the bounding box is always
  centered and its size varies randomly within the given range. For example if
  the scale percentage is zero, then the bounding box is the same size as the
  input and no scaling is applied. If it's 50%, then the bounding box will be in
  a random range between half the width and height and full size.

  Args:
    flip_left_right: Boolean whether to randomly mirror images horizontally.
    random_crop: Integer percentage setting the total margin used around the
    crop box.
    random_scale: Integer percentage of how much to vary the scale by.
