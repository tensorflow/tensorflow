// This class is designed to apply a very primitive decoding model on top of the
// instantaneous results from running an audio recognition model on a single
// window of samples. It applies smoothing over time so that noisy individual
// label scores are averaged, increasing the confidence that apparent matches
// are real.
// To use it, you should create a class object with the configuration you
// want, and then feed results from running a TensorFlow model into the
// processing method. The timestamp for each subsequent call should be
// increasing from the previous, since the class is designed to process a stream
// of data over time.
class RecognizeCommands {
 public:
  // labels should be a list of the strings associated with each one-hot score.
  // The window duration controls the smoothing. Longer durations will give a
  // higher confidence that the results are correct, but may miss some commands.
  // The detection threshold has a similar effect, with high values increasing
  // the precision at the cost of recall. The minimum count controls how many
  // results need to be in the averaging window before it's seen as a reliable
  // average. This prevents erroneous results when the averaging window is
  // initially being populated for example. The suppression argument disables
  // further recognitions for a set time after one has been triggered, which can
  // help reduce spurious recognitions.
