Pause for `delay` seconds (which need not be an integer).

This is an asynchronous (non-blocking) version of sleep. It is intended to
be an example of how to implement ops that do I/O or that block on other ops.

Returns the time spent in blocking sleep (which may be less that `delay` or
zero if other ops run while this is waiting asynchronously).
