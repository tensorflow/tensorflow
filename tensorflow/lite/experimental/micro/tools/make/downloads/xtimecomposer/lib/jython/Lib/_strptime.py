        mix of information from more than one locale.  This would most likely
        happen when using threads where one thread calls a locale-dependent
        function while another thread changes the locale while the function in
        the other thread is still running.  Proper coding would call for
        locks to prevent changing the locale while locale-dependent code is
        running.  The check here is done in case someone does not think about
        doing this.

        Only other possible issue is if someone changed the timezone and did
        not call tz.tzset .  That is an issue for the programmer, though,
