        By default, creates a multipart/mixed message, with proper
        Content-Type and MIME-Version headers.

        _subtype is the subtype of the multipart content type, defaulting to
        `mixed'.

        boundary is the multipart boundary string.  By default it is
        calculated as needed.

        _subparts is a sequence of initial subparts for the payload.  It
        must be an iterable object, such as a list.  You can always
        attach new subparts to the message by using the attach() method.

        Additional parameters for the Content-Type header are taken from the
        keyword arguments (or passed into the _params argument).
