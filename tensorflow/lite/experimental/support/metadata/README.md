# TensorFlow Lite Metadata and Android wrapper code generator

Note: Both TensorFlow Lite Metadata and the Android wrapper code generator are
in experimental (beta) phase.

TensorFlow Lite metadata provides a structured framework for storing metadata
to convey information for both the developer that will utilitised the model and
code generators which can create wrapper around the model. For information on
how to populate model metadata, please refer to the [TensorFlow Lite Metadata 
documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/convert/metadata).

The first code generator which takes advantage of this metadata format is the
TensorFlow Lite Android Code Generator. For more information on how to use this
generator, please refer to the [TensorFlow Lite Android wrapper code generator
documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/codegen).
