  Args:
    cell: An instance of RNNCell.
    inputs: The RNN inputs.
      If `time_major == False` (default), this must be a `Tensor` of shape:
        `[batch_size, max_time, ...]`, or a nested tuple of such elements.
      If `time_major == True`, this must be a `Tensor` of shape: `[max_time,
        batch_size, ...]`, or a nested tuple of such elements. This may also be
        a (possibly nested) tuple of Tensors satisfying this property.  The
        first two dimensions must match across all the inputs, but otherwise the
        ranks and other shape components may differ. In this case, input to
        `cell` at each time-step will replicate the structure of these tuples,
        except for the time dimension (from which the time is taken). The input
        to `cell` at each time step will be a `Tensor` or (possibly nested)
        tuple of Tensors each with dimensions `[batch_size, ...]`.
    sequence_length: (optional) An int32/int64 vector sized `[batch_size]`. Used
      to copy-through state and zero-out outputs when past a batch element's
      sequence length.  So it's more for performance than correctness.
    initial_state: (optional) An initial state for the RNN. If `cell.state_size`
      is an integer, this must be a `Tensor` of appropriate type and shape
      `[batch_size, cell.state_size]`. If `cell.state_size` is a tuple, this
      should be a tuple of tensors having shapes `[batch_size, s] for s in
      cell.state_size`.
    dtype: (optional) The data type for the initial state and expected output.
      Required if initial_state is not provided or RNN state has a heterogeneous
      dtype.
    parallel_iterations: (Default: 32).  The number of iterations to run in
      parallel.  Those operations which do not have any temporal dependency and
      can be run in parallel, will be.  This parameter trades off time for
      space.  Values >> 1 use more memory but take less time, while smaller
      values use less memory but computations take longer.
    swap_memory: Transparently swap the tensors produced in forward inference
      but needed for back prop from GPU to CPU.  This allows training RNNs which
      would typically not fit on a single GPU, with very minimal (or no)
      performance penalty.
    time_major: The shape format of the `inputs` and `outputs` Tensors. If true,
      these `Tensors` must be shaped `[max_time, batch_size, depth]`. If false,
      these `Tensors` must be shaped `[batch_size, max_time, depth]`. Using
      `time_major = True` is a bit more efficient because it avoids transposes
      at the beginning and end of the RNN calculation.  However, most TensorFlow
      data is batch-major, so by default this function accepts input and emits
      output in batch-major form.
    scope: VariableScope for the created subgraph; defaults to "rnn".

  Returns:
    A pair (outputs, state) where:

    outputs: The RNN output `Tensor`.

      If time_major == False (default), this will be a `Tensor` shaped:
        `[batch_size, max_time, cell.output_size]`.

      If time_major == True, this will be a `Tensor` shaped:
        `[max_time, batch_size, cell.output_size]`.

      Note, if `cell.output_size` is a (possibly nested) tuple of integers
      or `TensorShape` objects, then `outputs` will be a tuple having the
      same structure as `cell.output_size`, containing Tensors having shapes
      corresponding to the shape data in `cell.output_size`.

    state: The final state.  If `cell.state_size` is an int, this
      will be shaped `[batch_size, cell.state_size]`.  If it is a
      `TensorShape`, this will be shaped `[batch_size] + cell.state_size`.
      If it is a (possibly nested) tuple of ints or `TensorShape`, this will
      be a tuple having the corresponding shapes. If cells are `LSTMCells`
      `state` will be a tuple containing a `LSTMStateTuple` for each cell.

  Raises:
    TypeError: If `cell` is not an instance of RNNCell.
    ValueError: If inputs is None or an empty list.
    RuntimeError: If not using control flow v2.
