// DEPRECATED:
//   This function is deprecated, because it doesn't take delegates into
//   account, and as a result may report errors if the model contains
//   operators that are not supported by the OpResolver but that would be
//   rewritten by any TfLiteDelegate that you are using.
// Suggested replacement:
//   Use the version below that doesn't takes an OpResolver (and
//   doesn't check the validity of the ops) instead of this function,
//   and delay verification of the ops until after you have constructed
//   the Interpreter.  To verify that the operators in the model are supported
//   by the delegate(s) and/or by the OpResolver, construct the Interpreter,
//   applying the TfLiteDelegate(s) using InterpreterBuilder::AddDelegate,
//   and then just check the return value from Interpreter::AllocateTensors().
