            TensorFlow Lite uses TensorFlow models converted into a smaller, more efficient machine
            learning (ML) model format. You can use pre-trained models with TensorFlow Lite, modify
            existing models, or build your own TensorFlow models and then convert them to
            TensorFlow Lite format. TensorFlow Lite models can perform almost any task a regular
            TensorFlow model can do: object detection, natural language processing, pattern
            recognition, and more using a wide range of input data including images, video, audio,
            and text.

            <p>
            You don't have to build a TensorFlow Lite model to start using machine learning on
            mobile or edge devices. Many already-built and optimized models are available for you to
            use right away in your application. You can start with using pre-trained models in
            TensorFlow Lite and move up to building custom models over time, as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
            <li>Start developing machine learning features with already
            <a href="./trained">trained models.</a></li>
            <li>Modify existing TensorFlow Lite models using tools such as
            <a href="../guide/model_maker">Model Maker</a>.</li>
            <li>Build a
            <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/customization/custom_training_walkthrough">
            custom model</a> with TensorFlow tools and then
            <a href="../convert">convert</a> it to TensorFlow Lite.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
            If you are trying to quickly implement features or utility tasks with machine
            learning, you should review the use cases supported by
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/ml-kit">ML Kit</a> before starting
            development with TensorFlow Lite. This development tool provides APIs you can call
            directly from mobile apps to complete common ML tasks such as barcode scanning and
            on-device translation. Using this method can help you get results fast. However, ML Kit
            has limited options for extending its capabilities. For more information,
            see the <a href="https://developers.google.com/ml-kit">ML Kit</a> developer
            documentation.

            <h2 class="tfo-landing-page-heading no-link">Building models for your app: Constraints
            </h2>
            <p>
            If building a custom model for your specific use case is your ultimate goal, you should
            start with developing and training a TensorFlow model or extending an existing one.
            Before you start your model development process, you should be aware of the constraints
            for TensorFlow Lite models and build your model with these constraints in mind:
            <ul>
            <li><b>Limited compute capabilities</b> - Compared to fully equipped servers with
            multiple CPUs, high memory capacity, and specialized processors such as GPUs and TPUs,
            mobile and edge devices are much more limited, and models and data you can effectively
            process with them are limited.</li>
            <li><b>Size of models</b> - The overall complexity of a model, including data
            pre-processing logic and the number of layers in the model, increases the in-memory
            size of a model. A large model may run unacceptably slow or simply may not fit in the
            available memory of a mobile or edge device.</li>
            <li><b>Size of data</b> - The size of input data that can be effectively processed with
            a machine learning model is limited on a mobile or edge device. Models that use large
            data libraries such language libraries, image libraries, or video clip libraries may not
            fit on these devices, and may require off-device storage and access solutions.</li>
            <li><b>Supported TensorFlow operations</b> - TensorFlow Lite runtime environments
            support a smaller number of machine learning model operations compared to regular
            TensorFlow models. As you develop a model for use with TensorFlow Lite, you should track
            the compatibility of your model against the capabilities of TensorFlow Lite runtime
            environments.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
