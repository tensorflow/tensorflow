# TensorFlow Lite Model Maker

## Overview

The TensorFlow Lite Model Maker library simplifies the process of training a
TensorFlow Lite model using custom dataset. It uses transfer learning to reduce
the amount of training data required and shorten the training time.

## Supported Tasks

The Model Maker library currently supports the following ML tasks. Click the
links below for guides on how to train the model.

If your tasks are not supported, please first use [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide)
to retrain a TensorFlow model with transfer learning (following guides like
[images](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning),
[text](https://www.tensorflow.org/official_models/fine_tuning_bert),
[audio](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/audio/transfer_learning_audio)) or
train it from scratch, and then [convert](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/convert)
it to TensorFlow Lite model.

## End-to-End Example

Model Maker allows you to train a TensorFlow Lite model using custom datasets in
just a few lines of code. For example, here are the steps to train an image
classification model.

```python
from tflite_model_maker import image_classifier
from tflite_model_maker.image_classifier import DataLoader

# Load input data specific to an on-device ML app.
data = DataLoader.from_folder('flower_photos/')
train_data, test_data = data.split(0.9)

# Customize the TensorFlow model.
model = image_classifier.create(train_data)

# Evaluate the model.
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(test_data)

# Export to Tensorflow Lite model and label file in `export_dir`.
model.export(export_dir='/tmp/')
```

[image classification guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/modify/model_maker/image_classification).

## Installation

There are two ways to install Model Maker.

*   Install a prebuilt pip package.

```shell
pip install tflite-model-maker
```

If you want to install nightly version, please follow the command:

```shell
pip install tflite-model-maker-nightly
```

*   Clone the source code from GitHub and install.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/examples
cd examples/tensorflow_examples/lite/model_maker/pip_package
pip install -e .
```

TensorFlow Lite Model Maker depends on TensorFlow
[pip package](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip). For GPU drivers, please
refer to TensorFlow's [GPU guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu) or
[installation guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).
