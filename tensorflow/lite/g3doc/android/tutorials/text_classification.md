# Text classification with Android

This tutorial shows you how to build an Android application using TensorFlow
Lite to classify natural language text. This application is designed for a
physical Android device but can also run on a device emulator.

The
[example application](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/text_classification/android)
uses TensorFlow Lite to classify text as either positive or negative, using the
[Task library for natural language (NL)](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert/libraries/task_library/overview)
to enable execution of the text classification machine learning models.

If you are updating an existing project, you can use the example application as
a reference or template. For instructions on how to add text classification to
an existing application, refer to
[Updating and modifying your application](#modify_applications).

## Text classification overview

*Text classification* is the machine learning task of assigning a set of
predefined categories to open-ended text. A text classification model is trained
on a corpus of natural language text, where words or phrases are manually
classified.

The trained model receives text as input and attempts to categorize the text
according to the set of known classes it was trained to classify. For example,
the models in this example accept a snippet of text and determines whether the
sentiment of the text is positive or negative. For each snippet of text, the
text classification model outputs a score that indicates the confidence of the
text being correctly classified as either positive or negative.

For more information on how the models in this tutorial are generated, refer to
the
[Text classification with TensorFlow Lite Model Maker](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert/libraries/modify/text_classification)
tutorial.

## Models and dataset

This tutorial uses models that were trained using the
[SST-2](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/index.html) (Stanford Sentiment
Treebank) dataset. SST-2 contains 67,349 movie reviews for training and 872
movie reviews for testing, with each review categorized as either positive or
negative. The models used in this app were trained using the TensorFlow Lite
[Model Maker](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert/libraries/modify/text_classification)
tool.

The example application uses the following pre-trained models:

*   [Average Word Vector](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/inference_with_metadata/task_library/nl_classifier)
    (`NLClassifier`) - The Task Library's `NLClassifier` classifies input text
    into different categories, and can handle most text classification models.

*   [MobileBERT](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/inference_with_metadata/task_library/bert_nl_classifier)
    (`BertNLClassifier`) - The Task Library's `BertNLClassifier` is similar to
    the NLClassifier but is tailored for cases that require out-of-graph
    Wordpiece and Sentencepiece tokenizations.

## Setup and run the example app

To setup the text classification application, download the example app from
[GitHub](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/text_classification/android)
and run it using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/).

### System requirements

*   **[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)**
    version 2021.1.1 (Bumblebee) or higher.
*   Android SDK version 31 or higher
*   Android device with a minimum OS version of SDK 21 (Android 7.0 - Nougat)
    with
    [developer mode](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options)
    enabled, or an Android Emulator.

### Get the example code

Create a local copy of the example code. You will use this code to create a
project in Android Studio and run the example application.

To clone and setup the example code:

1.  Clone the git repository
    <pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
    git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/examples.git
    </pre>
2.  Optionally, configure your git instance to use sparse checkout, so you have only
    the files for the text classification example app:
    <pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
    cd examples
    git sparse-checkout init --cone
    git sparse-checkout set lite/examples/text_classification/android
    </pre>

### Import and run the project

Create a project from the downloaded example code, build the project, and then
run it.

To import and build the example code project:

1.  Start [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
1.  From the Android Studio, select **File > New > Import Project**.
1.  Navigate to the example code directory containing the build.gradle file
    (`.../examples/lite/examples/text_classification/android/build.gradle`) and
    select that directory.
1.  If Android Studio requests a Gradle Sync, choose OK.
1.  Ensure that your Android device is connected to your computer and developer
    mode is enabled. Click the green `Run` arrow.

If you select the correct directory, Android Studio creates a new project and
builds it. This process can take a few minutes, depending on the speed of your
computer and if you have used Android Studio for other projects. When the build
completes, the Android Studio displays a `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message in the
**Build Output** status panel.

To run the project:

1.  From Android Studio, run the project by selecting **Run > Runâ€¦**.
1.  Select an attached Android device (or emulator) to test the app.

### Using the application

![Text classification example app in Android](../../../images/lite/android/text-classification-screenshot.png){: .attempt-right width="250px"}

After running the project in Android Studio, the application will automatically
open on the connected device or device emulator.

To use the text classifier:

1.  Enter a snippet of text in the text box.
1.  From the **Delegate** drop-down, choose either `CPU` or `NNAPI`.
1.  Specify a model by choosing either `AverageWordVec` or `MobileBERT`.
1.  Choose **Classify**.

The application outputs a *positive* score and a *negative* score. These two
scores will sum to 1, and measures the likelihood that the sentiment of the
input text is positive or negative. A higher number denotes a higher level of
confidence.

You now have a functioning text classification application. Use the following
sections to better understand how the example application works, and how to
implement text classification features to your production applications:

*   [How the application works](#how_it_works) - A walkthrough of the structure
    and key files of the example application.

*   [Modify your application](#modify_applications) - Instructions on adding
    text classification to an existing application.

## How the example app works {:#how_it_works}

The application uses the
[Task library for natural language (NL)](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert/libraries/task_library/overview)
package to implement the text classification models. The two models, Average
Word Vector and MobileBERT, were trained using the TensorFlow Lite
[Model Maker](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert/libraries/modify/text_classification).
The application runs on CPU by default, with the option of hardware acceleration
using the NNAPI delegate.

The following files and directories contain the crucial code for this text
classification application:

*   [TextClassificationHelper.kt](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/lite/examples/text_classification/android/app/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/lite/examples/textclassification/TextClassificationHelper.kt) -
    Initializes the text classifier and handles the model and delegate
    selection.
*   [MainActivity.kt](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/lite/examples/text_classification/android/app/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/lite/examples/textclassification/MainActivity.kt) -
    Implements the application, including calling `TextClassificationHelper` and
    `ResultsAdapter`.
*   [ResultsAdapter.kt](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/lite/examples/text_classification/android/app/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/lite/examples/textclassification/ResultsAdapter.kt) -
    Handles and formats the results.

## Modify your application {:#modify_applications}

The following sections explain the key steps to modify your own Android app to
run the model shown in the example app. These instructions use the example app
as a reference point. The specific changes needed for your own app may vary from
the example app.

### Open or create an Android project

You need an Android development project in Android Studio to follow along with
the rest of these instructions. Follow the instructions below to open an
existing project or create a new one.

To open an existing Android development project:

*   In Android Studio, select *File > Open* and select an existing project.

To create a basic Android development project:

*   Follow the instructions in Android Studio to
    [Create a basic project](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/create-project).

For more information on using Android Studio, refer to the
[Android Studio documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro).

### Add project dependencies

In your own application, you must add specific project dependencies to run
TensorFlow Lite machine learning models, and access utility functions that
convert data such as strings, into a tensor data format that can be processed by
the model you are using.

The following instructions explain how to add the required project and module
dependencies to your own Android app project.

To add module dependencies:

1.  In the module that uses TensorFlow Lite, update the module's `build.gradle`
    file to include the following dependencies.

    In the example application, the dependencies are located in
    [app/build.gradle](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/lite/examples/text_classification/android/app/build.gradle):

    ```
    dependencies {
      ...
      implementation 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite-task-text:0.4.0'
    }
    ```

    The project must include the Text task library
    (`tensorflow-lite-task-text`).

    If you want to modify this app to run on a graphics processing unit (GPU),
    the GPU library (`tensorflow-lite-gpu-delegate-plugin`) provides the
    infrastructure to run the app on GPU, and Delegate (`tensorflow-lite-gpu`)
    provides the compatibility list. Running this app on GPU is outside the
    scope of this tutorial.

1.  In Android Studio, sync the project dependencies by selecting: **File > Sync
    Project with Gradle Files**.

### Initialize the ML models {:#initialize_models}

In your Android app, you must initialize the TensorFlow Lite machine learning
model with parameters before running predictions with the model.

A TensorFlow Lite model is stored as a `*.tflite` file. The model file contains
the prediction logic and typically includes
[metadata](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert/models/metadata) about how to
interpret prediction results, such as prediction class names. Typically, model
files are stored in the `src/main/assets` directory of your development project,
as in the code example:

-   `<project>/src/main/assets/mobilebert.tflite`
-   `<project>/src/main/assets/wordvec.tflite`

Note: The example app uses a
`[download_model.gradle](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/lite/examples/text_classification/android/app/download_model.gradle)`
file to download the
[Average Word Vector](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/inference_with_metadata/task_library/nl_classifier)
and
[MobileBERT](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/inference_with_metadata/task_library/bert_nl_classifier)
models at build time. This approach is not necessary or recommended for a
production app.

For convenience and code readability, the example declares a companion object
that defines the settings for the model.

To initialize the model in your app:

1.  Create a companion object to define the settings for the model. In the
    example application, this object is located in
    [TextClassificationHelper.kt](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/lite/examples/text_classification/android/app/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/lite/examples/textclassification/TextClassificationHelper.kt):

    ```
    companion object {
      const val DELEGATE_CPU = 0
      const val DELEGATE_NNAPI = 1
      const val WORD_VEC = "wordvec.tflite"
      const val MOBILEBERT = "mobilebert.tflite"
    }
    ```

1.  Create the settings for the model by building a classifier object, and
    construct a TensorFlow Lite object using either `BertNLClassifier` or
    `NLClassifier`.

    In the example application, this is located in the `initClassifier` function
    within
    [TextClassificationHelper.kt](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/lite/examples/text_classification/android/app/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/lite/examples/textclassification/TextClassificationHelper.kt):

    ```
    fun initClassifier() {
      ...
      if( currentModel == MOBILEBERT ) {
        ...
        bertClassifier = BertNLClassifier.createFromFileAndOptions(
          context,
          MOBILEBERT,
          options)
      } else if (currentModel == WORD_VEC) {
          ...
          nlClassifier = NLClassifier.createFromFileAndOptions(
            context,
            WORD_VEC,
            options)
      }
    }
    ```

    Note: Most production apps using text classification will use either
    `BertNLClassifier` or `NLClassifier` - not both.

### Enable hardware acceleration (optional) {:#hardware_acceleration}

When initializing a TensorFlow Lite model in your app, you should consider using
hardware acceleration features to speed up the prediction calculations of the
model. TensorFlow Lite
[delegates](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/delegates) are software
modules that accelerate execution of machine learning models using specialized
processing hardware on a mobile device, such as graphics processing unit (GPUs)
or tensor processing units (TPUs).

To enable hardware acceleration in your app:

1.  Create a variable to define the delegate that the application will use. In
    the example application, this variable is located early in
    [TextClassificationHelper.kt](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/lite/examples/text_classification/android/app/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/lite/examples/textclassification/TextClassificationHelper.kt):

    ```
    var currentDelegate: Int = 0
    ```

1.  Create a delegate selector. In the example application, the delegate
    selector is located in the `initClassifier` function within
    [TextClassificationHelper.kt](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/lite/examples/text_classification/android/app/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/lite/examples/textclassification/TextClassificationHelper.kt):

    ```
    val baseOptionsBuilder = BaseOptions.builder()
    when (currentDelegate) {
       DELEGATE_CPU -> {
           // Default
       }
       DELEGATE_NNAPI -> {
           baseOptionsBuilder.useNnapi()
       }
    }
    ```

Note: It is possible to modify this app to use a GPU delegate, but this requires
that the classifier be created on the same thread that is using the classifier.
This is outside of the scope of this tutorial.

Using delegates for running TensorFlow Lite models is recommended, but not
required. For more information about using delegates with TensorFlow Lite, see
[TensorFlow Lite Delegates](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/delegates).

### Prepare data for the model

In your Android app, your code provides data to the model for interpretation by
transforming existing data such as raw text into a
[Tensor](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/api_docs/java/org/tensorflow/lite/Tensor)
data format that can be processed by your model. The data in a Tensor you pass
to a model must have specific dimensions, or shape, that matches the format of
data used to train the model.

This text classification app accepts a
[string](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/String.html) as
input, and the models are trained exclusively on an English language corpus.
Special characters and non-English words are ignored during inference.

To provide text data to the model:

1.  Ensure that the `initClassifier` function contains the code for the delegate
    and models, as explained in the
    [Initialize the ML models](#initialize_models) and
    [Enable hardware acceleration](#hardware_acceleration) sections.

1.  Use the `init` block to call the `initClassifier` function. In the example
    application, the `init` is located in
    [TextClassificationHelper.kt](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/lite/examples/text_classification/android/app/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/lite/examples/textclassification/TextClassificationHelper.kt):

    ```
    init {
      initClassifier()
    }
    ```

### Run predictions

In your Android app, once you have initialized either a
[BertNLClassifier](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/api_docs/java/org/tensorflow/lite/task/text/nlclassifier/BertNLClassifier)
or
[NLClassifier](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/api_docs/java/org/tensorflow/lite/task/text/nlclassifier/NLClassifier)
object, you can begin feeding input text for the model to categorize as
"positive" or "negative".

To run predictions:

1.  Create a `classify` function, which uses the selected classifier
    (`currentModel`) and measures the time taken to classify the input text
    (`inferenceTime`). In the example application, the `classify` function is
    located in
    [TextClassificationHelper.kt](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/lite/examples/text_classification/android/app/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/lite/examples/textclassification/TextClassificationHelper.kt):

    ```
    fun classify(text: String) {
      executor = ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor(1)

      executor.execute {
        val results: List<Category>
        // inferenceTime is the amount of time, in milliseconds, that it takes to
        // classify the input text.
        var inferenceTime = SystemClock.uptimeMillis()

        // Use the appropriate classifier based on the selected model
        if(currentModel == MOBILEBERT) {
          results = bertClassifier.classify(text)
        } else {
          results = nlClassifier.classify(text)
        }

        inferenceTime = SystemClock.uptimeMillis() - inferenceTime

        listener.onResult(results, inferenceTime)
      }
    }
    ```

1.  Pass the results from `classify` to the listener object.

    ```
    fun classify(text: String) {
      ...
      listener.onResult(results, inferenceTime)
    }
    ```

### Handle model output

After you input a line of text, the model produces a prediction score, expressed
as a Float, between 0 and 1 for the 'positive' and 'negative' categories.

To get the prediction results from the model:

1.  Create an `onResult` function for the listener object to handle the output.
    In the example application, the listener object is located in
    [MainActivity.kt](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/lite/examples/text_classification/android/app/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/lite/examples/textclassification/MainActivity.kt)

    ```
    private val listener = object : TextClassificationHelper.TextResultsListener {
      override fun onResult(results: List<Category>, inferenceTime: Long) {
        runOnUiThread {
          activityMainBinding.bottomSheetLayout.inferenceTimeVal.text =
            String.format("%d ms", inferenceTime)

          adapter.resultsList = results.sortedByDescending {
            it.score
          }

          adapter.notifyDataSetChanged()
        }
      }
      ...
    }
    ```

1.  Add an `onError` function to the listener object to handle errors:

    ```
      private val listener = object : TextClassificationHelper.TextResultsListener {
        ...
        override fun onError(error: String) {
          Toast.makeText(this@MainActivity, error, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
        }
      }
    ```

Once the model has returned a set of prediction results, your application can
act on those predictions by presenting the result to your user or executing
additional logic. The example application lists the prediction scores in the
user interface.
