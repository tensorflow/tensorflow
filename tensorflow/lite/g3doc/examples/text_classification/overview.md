# Text classification

Use a TensorFlow Lite model to category a paragraph into predefined groups.

Note: (1) To integrate an existing model, try
[TensorFlow Lite Task Library](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/inference_with_metadata/task_library/nl_classifier).
(2) To customize a model, try
[TensorFlow Lite Model Maker](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert/libraries/modify/text_classification).

## Get started

If you are new to TensorFlow Lite and are working with Android, we recommend
exploring the guide of
[TensorFLow Lite Task Library](../../inference_with_metadata/task_library/nl_classifier.md)
to integrate text classification models within just a few lines of code. You can
also integrate the model using the
[TensorFlow Lite Interpreter Java API](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/g3doc/guide/inference.md#load-and-run-a-model-in-java).

The Android example below demonstrates the implementation for both methods as
[lib_task_api](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/text_classification/android/lib_task_api)
and
[lib_interpreter](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/text_classification/android/lib_interpreter),
respectively.

If you are using a platform other than Android, or you are already familiar with
the TensorFlow Lite APIs, you can download our starter text classification
model.

## How it works

Text classification categorizes a paragraph into predefined groups based on its
content.

This pretrained model predicts if a paragraph's sentiment is positive or
negative. It was trained on
[Large Movie Review Dataset v1.0](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
from Mass et al, which consists of IMDB movie reviews labeled as either positive
or negative.

Here are the steps to classify a paragraph with the model:

1.  Tokenize the paragraph and convert it to a list of word ids using a
    predefined vocabulary.
1.  Feed the list to the TensorFlow Lite model.
1.  Get the probability of the paragraph being positive or negative from the
    model outputs.

### Note

*   Only English is supported.
*   This model was trained on movie reviews dataset so you may experience
    reduced accuracy when classifying text of other domains.

## Performance benchmarks

Performance benchmark numbers are generated with the tool
[described here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/benchmarks).

## Use your training dataset

Follow this
[tutorial](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert/libraries/modify/text_classification)
to apply the same technique used here to train a text classification model using
your own datasets. With the right dataset, you can create a model for use cases
such as document categorization or toxic comments detection.
