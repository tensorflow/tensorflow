// === Summary ===
//
// TLDR: Some of our 8-bit arithmetic operations require uint8 weight values
// to avoid the value 0, thus ranging only in [1, 255]. This enables faster
// runtime arithmetic kernels on ARM NEON. This is not relevant on most
// other hardware architectures, and will cease to be relevant on ARM NEON
// in the future. These topics are elaborated below ("Context").
//
// Having just one isolated uint8 value equal to 0 is fine. The bad case is when
// two uint8 values are both zero and are less than 16 bytes apart.
//
// By default, toco generates a fatal error when that happens. The user may opt
// in to more lax behavior by passing
//   --allow_nudging_weights_to_use_fast_gemm_kernel.
// This causes toco to nudge such bad 0 values into the value 1, thus avoiding
// the problem in exchange for compromising on accuracy.
//
// The present graph transformation implements both the default fatal-erroring
// behavior, and, when allow_nudging_weights is set, also the lax nudging
// behavior.
//
//
// === Context ===
//
// Since March 2017, we have been using a trick to perform faster
// 8bit matrix multiplications, to our knowledge first implemented in gemmlowp
// here:
//   https://github.com/google/gemmlowp/commit/25b2989415b99e797e1ab977837111b2e231f81f
//
// This trick is explained in Appendix B of our paper,
//   https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05877
//
// Here is the relevant paragraph:
//
//      For efficient NEON implementation of the matrix multiplication’s
//      core accumulation, we use the following trick.
//      In the multiply-add operation in (10), we first change the
//      operands’ type from uint8 to int8 (which can be done by
//      subtracting 128 from the quantized values and zero-points).
//      Thus the core multiply-add becomes
//
//            int32 += int8 * int8. (B.1)
//
//      As mentioned in section 3, with a minor tweak of the quantized
//      training process, we can ensure that the weights, once
//      quantized as int8 values, never take the value −128. Hence,
//      the product in (B.1) is never −128 ∗ −128, and is therefore
//      always less than 2^14 in absolute value. Hence, (B.1)
//      can accumulate two products on a local int16 accumulator
//      before that needs to be accumulated into the true int32 accumulator.
//      This allows the use of an 8-way SIMD multiplication
//      (SMULL on int8 operands), followed by an 8-way
//      SIMD multiply-add (SMLAL on int8 operands), followed
//      by a pairwise-add-and-accumulate into the int32 accumulators
//      (SADALP).
//
// As that paragraph notes, quantized training should be suitably modified to
// ensure that quantized uint8 weights value only range in [1, 255]. So the
// problem that we are dealing with is only about the existing 8-bit quantized
// models that haven't been trained specifically to get 8-bit weights only in
// [1, 255].
//
// This spreadsheet shows the speed benefit of this trick across many existing
// ARM-architecture CPUs:
//
//    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-0LjdMvW0XtH1bYknC0bQINoFaxjTuL9eplZZcitykI/edit?usp=sharing
//
// Compare Row 18 (fast int8 trick) to Row 20 (regular uint8 kernel).
//
// The introduction of the 'dotprod' extension to ARM NEON, specifically the
// SDOT instruction, renders this eventually moot. See the experimental
// kernels contributed by ARM here,
//
//     https://github.com/google/gemmlowp/pull/116
//
// However, as of April 2018, there don't seem to be any commercially available
// CPU supporting these instructions (yet); we are waiting for
// Cortex-A{75,55}-r1 to become available; the "-r1" is key here. Even if such
// CPUs become available soon, it will presumably take years for them to
// overtake the large volume of existing CPUs not supporting these new
// instructions, especially in current and future low-end devices. All in all,
// we can foresee these 'fast int8 kernels' to remain important to have into
// the 2020s.

      // the fast int8 kernel trick is only applicable to ops that either are
      // implemented as a GEMM, or use symmetric ranges for both weights and

      // it can use techniques reducing its implementation to the symmetric
