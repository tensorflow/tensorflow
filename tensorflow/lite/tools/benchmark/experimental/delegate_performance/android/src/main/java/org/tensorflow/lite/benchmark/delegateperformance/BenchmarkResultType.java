  //    delegate, but not substantially worse. No regression thresholds are
  //    breached.
  //    - FAIL: At least 1 regression threshold is breached.
  // 2. When the test target delegate type is different from the reference
  // delegate: the test delegate is only expected to be better, or at least not
  // substantially worse, than the reference delegate in AT LEAST 1 metric.
  //    - PASS: All performance metrics of the test target delegate are better than
  //    or equal to the reference delegate.
