# their internal symbols. Only allowed symbols will be visible in the
# symbol table after this script.

# To run this script, you must set several variables:
#   INPUT_FRAMEWORK: a zip file containing the iOS static framework.
#   BUNDLE_NAME: the pod/bundle name of the iOS static framework.
#   ALLOWLIST_FILE_PATH: contains the allowed symbols.
#   EXTRACT_SCRIPT_PATH: path to the extract_object_files script.
#   OUTPUT: the output zip file.

# Halt on any error or any unknown variable.
