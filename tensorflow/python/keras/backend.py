    # slightly increase the size of the global state managed by Keras

      time_major: Boolean. If true, the inputs and outputs will be in shape
          `(timesteps, batch, ...)`, whereas in the False case, it will be
          `(batch, timesteps, ...)`. Using `time_major = True` is a bit more
          efficient because it avoids transposes at the beginning and end of the
          RNN calculation. However, most TensorFlow data is batch-major, so by
          default this function accepts input and emits output in batch-major
          form.
      zero_output_for_mask: Boolean. If True, the output for masked timestep
          will be zeros, whereas in the False case, output from previous
          timestep is returned.

  Returns:
      A tuple, `(last_output, outputs, new_states)`.
          last_output: the latest output of the rnn, of shape `(samples, ...)`
          outputs: tensor with shape `(samples, time, ...)` where each
              entry `outputs[s, t]` is the output of the step function
              at time `t` for sample `s`.
          new_states: list of tensors, latest states returned by
              the step function, of shape `(samples, ...)`.

  Raises:
      ValueError: if input dimension is less than 3.
      ValueError: if `unroll` is `True` but input timestep is not a fixed
      number.
      ValueError: if `mask` is provided (not `None`) but states is not provided
          (`len(states)` == 0).

  This class is similar to defaultdict, where values may be produced by the

  value for the key (when key is `None`) -- the key is set to the current graph
  or eager context. The default factories for key and value are only used in
  `__getitem__` and `setdefault`. The `.get()` behavior remains the same.

  This object will return the value of the current graph or closest parent graph
  if the current graph is a function. This is to reflect the fact that if a
  tensor is created in eager/graph, child functions may capture that tensor.

  The default factory method may accept keyword arguments (unlike defaultdict,
  which only accepts callables with 0 arguments). To pass keyword arguments to
  `default_factory`, use the `setdefault` method instead of `__getitem__`.

  An example of how this class can be used in different contexts:

  ```
  cache = ContextValueCache(int)

  # Eager mode
  cache[None] += 2
  cache[None] += 4
  assert cache[None] == 6

  # Graph mode
  with tf.Graph().as_default() as g:
    cache[None] += 5
    cache[g] += 3
  assert cache[g] == 8
  ```

  Example of a default factory with arguments:

  ```
  cache = ContextValueCache(lambda x: x + 1)
  g = tf.get_default_graph()

  # Example with keyword argument.
  value = cache.setdefault(key=g, kwargs={'x': 3})
