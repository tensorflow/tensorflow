class ReductionV2(object):
  """Types of loss reduction.

  Contains the following values:

  * `AUTO`: Indicates that the reduction option will be determined by the usage
     context. For almost all cases this defaults to `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. When
     used with `tf.distribute.Strategy`, outside of built-in training loops such
     as `tf.keras` `compile` and `fit`, we expect reduction value to be
     `SUM` or `NONE`. Using `AUTO` in that case will raise an error.
  * `NONE`: No **additional** reduction is applied to the output of the wrapped
     loss function. When non-scalar losses are returned to Keras functions like
     `fit`/`evaluate`, the unreduced vector loss is passed to the optimizer
     but the reported loss will be a scalar value.

     Caution: **Verify the shape of the outputs when using** `Reduction.NONE`.
     The builtin loss functions wrapped by the loss classes reduce
     one dimension (`axis=-1`, or `axis` if specified by loss function).
     `Reduction.NONE` just means that no **additional** reduction is applied by
     the class wrapper. For categorical losses with an example input shape of
     `[batch, W, H, n_classes]` the `n_classes` dimension is reduced. For
     pointwise losses your must include a dummy axis so that `[batch, W, H, 1]`
     is reduced to `[batch, W, H]`. Without the dummy axis `[batch, W, H]`
     will be incorrectly reduced to `[batch, W]`.

  * `SUM`: Scalar sum of weighted losses.
  * `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`: Scalar `SUM` divided by number of elements in losses.
     This reduction type is not supported when used with
     `tf.distribute.Strategy` outside of built-in training loops like `tf.keras`
     `compile`/`fit`.

     You can implement 'SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE' using global batch size like:
     ```
     with strategy.scope():
       loss_obj = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(
           reduction=tf.keras.losses.Reduction.NONE)
       ....
       loss = tf.reduce_sum(loss_obj(labels, predictions)) *
           (1. / global_batch_size)
     ```

  Please see the [custom training guide](
  https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/custom_training) for more
  details on this.

  In the common case where we expect shapes to match, `expected_rank_diff`

  But, for example, if `labels` contains class IDs and `predictions` contains 1
  probability per class, we expect `predictions` to have 1 more dimension than
  `labels`, so `expected_rank_diff` would be 1. In this case, we'd squeeze
  `labels` if `rank(predictions) - rank(labels) == 0`, and
