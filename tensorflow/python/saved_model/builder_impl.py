  """Builds the `SavedModel` protocol buffer and saves variables and assets.

  The `SavedModelBuilder` class provides the functionality to build a
  `SavedModel` protocol buffer. Specifically, this allows multiple meta
  graphs to be saved as part of a single language-neutral `SavedModel`,
  while sharing variables and assets.

  To build a SavedModel, the first meta graph must be saved with variables.
  Subsequent meta graphs will simply be saved with their graph definitions. If
  assets need to be saved and written or copied to disk, they can be provided
  when the meta graph def is added. If multiple meta graph defs are associated
  an asset of the same name, only the first version is retained.

  Each meta graph added to the SavedModel must be annotated with tags. The tags
  provide a means to identify the specific meta graph to load and restore, along
  with the shared set of variables and assets.

  Typical usage for the `SavedModelBuilder`:

  ```python
  ...
  builder = tf.compat.v1.saved_model.Builder(export_dir)

  with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=tf.Graph()) as sess:
    ...
    builder.add_meta_graph_and_variables(sess,
                                    ["foo-tag"],
                                    signature_def_map=foo_signatures,
                                    assets_list=foo_assets)
  ...

  with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=tf.Graph()) as sess:
    ...
    builder.add_meta_graph(["bar-tag", "baz-tag"])
  ...

  builder.save()
  ```

  Note: This function will only be available through the v1 compatibility
  library as tf.compat.v1.saved_model.builder.SavedModelBuilder or
  tf.compat.v1.saved_model.Builder. Tensorflow 2.0 will introduce a new
  object-based method of creating SavedModels.
