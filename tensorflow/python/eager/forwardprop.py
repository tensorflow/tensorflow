@tf_export("autodiff.ForwardAccumulator", v1=[])
class ForwardAccumulator():
  """Computes Jacobian-vector products ("JVP"s) using forward-mode autodiff.

  Compare to `tf.GradientTape` which computes vector-Jacobian products ("VJP"s)
  using reverse-mode autodiff (backprop). Reverse mode is more attractive when
  computing gradients of a scalar-valued function with respect to many inputs
  (e.g. a neural network with many parameters and a scalar loss). Forward mode
  works best on functions with many outputs and few inputs. Since it does not
  hold on to intermediate activations, it is much more memory efficient than
  backprop where it is applicable.

  Consider a simple linear regression:

  >>> x = tf.constant([[2.0, 3.0], [1.0, 4.0]])
  >>> targets = tf.constant([[1.], [-1.]])
  >>> dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
  >>> dense.build([None, 2])
  >>> with tf.autodiff.ForwardAccumulator(
  ...    primals=dense.kernel,
  ...    tangents=tf.constant([[1.], [0.]])) as acc:
  ...   loss = tf.reduce_sum((dense(x) - targets) ** 2.)
  >>> acc.jvp(loss)
  <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=...>

  The example has two variables containing parameters, `dense.kernel` (2
  parameters) and `dense.bias` (1 parameter). Considering the training data `x`
  as a constant, this means the Jacobian matrix for the function mapping from
  parameters to loss has one row and three columns.

  With forwardprop, we specify a length-three vector in advance which multiplies
  the Jacobian. The `primals` constructor argument is the parameter (a
  `tf.Tensor` or `tf.Variable`) we're specifying a vector for, and the
  `tangents` argument is the "vector" in Jacobian-vector product. If our goal is
  to compute the entire Jacobian matrix, forwardprop computes one column at a
  time while backprop computes one row at a time. Since the Jacobian in the
  linear regression example has only one row, backprop requires fewer
  invocations:

  >>> x = tf.constant([[2.0, 3.0], [1.0, 4.0]])
  >>> targets = tf.constant([[1.], [-1.]])
  >>> dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
  >>> dense.build([None, 2])
  >>> loss_fn = lambda: tf.reduce_sum((dense(x) - targets) ** 2.)
  >>> kernel_fprop = []
  >>> with tf.autodiff.ForwardAccumulator(
  ...     dense.kernel, tf.constant([[1.], [0.]])) as acc:
  ...   kernel_fprop.append(acc.jvp(loss_fn()))
  >>> with tf.autodiff.ForwardAccumulator(
  ...     dense.kernel, tf.constant([[0.], [1.]])) as acc:
  ...   kernel_fprop.append(acc.jvp(loss_fn()))
  >>> with tf.autodiff.ForwardAccumulator(dense.bias, tf.constant([1.])) as acc:
  ...   bias_fprop = acc.jvp(loss_fn())
  >>> with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  ...   loss = loss_fn()
  >>> kernel_grad, bias_grad = tape.gradient(loss, (dense.kernel, dense.bias))
  >>> np.testing.assert_allclose(
  ...     kernel_grad, tf.stack(kernel_fprop)[:, tf.newaxis])
  >>> np.testing.assert_allclose(bias_grad, bias_fprop[tf.newaxis])

  Implicit in the `tape.gradient` call is a length-one vector which
  left-multiplies the Jacobian, a vector-Jacobian product.

  `ForwardAccumulator` maintains JVPs corresponding primal tensors it is
  watching, derived from the original `primals` specified in the constructor. As
  soon as a primal tensor is deleted, `ForwardAccumulator` deletes the
  corresponding JVP.

  `acc.jvp(x)` retrieves `acc`'s JVP corresponding to the primal tensor `x`. It
  does not perform any computation. `acc.jvp` calls can be repeated as long as
  `acc` is accessible, whether the context manager is active or not. New JVPs
  are only computed while the context manager is active.

  Note that `ForwardAccumulator`s are always applied in the order their context
  managers were entered, so inner accumulators will not see JVP computation from
  outer accumulators. Take higher-order JVPs from outer accumulators:

  >>> primal = tf.constant(1.1)
  >>> with tf.autodiff.ForwardAccumulator(primal, tf.constant(1.)) as outer:
  ...   with tf.autodiff.ForwardAccumulator(primal, tf.constant(1.)) as inner:
  ...     primal_out = primal ** tf.constant(3.5)
  >>> inner_jvp = inner.jvp(primal_out)
  >>> inner_jvp  # 3.5 * 1.1 ** 2.5
  <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=4.4417057>
  >>> outer.jvp(inner_jvp)  # 3.5 * 2.5 * 1.1 ** 1.5
  <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=10.094786>

  Reversing the collection in the last line to instead retrieve
  `inner.jvp(outer.jvp(primal_out))` will not work.

  Strict nesting also applies to combinations of `ForwardAccumulator` and
  `tf.GradientTape`. More deeply nested `GradientTape` objects will ignore the
  products of outer `ForwardAccumulator` objects. This allows (for example)
  memory-efficient forward-over-backward computation of Hessian-vector products,
  where the inner `GradientTape` would otherwise hold on to all intermediate
  JVPs:

  >>> v = tf.Variable([1., 2.])
  >>> with tf.autodiff.ForwardAccumulator(
  ...     v,
  ...     # The "vector" in Hessian-vector product.
  ...     tf.constant([1., 0.])) as acc:
  ...   with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  ...     y = tf.reduce_sum(v ** 3.)
  ...   backward = tape.gradient(y, v)
  >>> backward  # gradient from backprop
  <tf.Tensor: shape=(2,), dtype=float32, numpy=array([ 3., 12.], dtype=float32)>
  >>> acc.jvp(backward)  # forward-over-backward Hessian-vector product
  <tf.Tensor: shape=(2,), dtype=float32, numpy=array([6., 0.], dtype=float32)>
