# Using TensorRT in TensorFlow (TF-TRT)

Note: Starting from v.2.18.0, TensorFlow doesn't support TensorRT.

This module provides necessary bindings and introduces `TRTEngineOp` operator
that wraps a subgraph in TensorRT. This module is under active development.

## Installing TF-TRT

Currently TensorFlow nightly builds include TF-TRT by default, which means you
don't need to install TF-TRT separately. You can pull the latest TF containers
from docker hub or install the latest TF pip package to get access to the latest
TF-TRT.

If you want to use TF-TRT on NVIDIA Jetson platform, you can find the download
links for the relevant TensorFlow pip packages here:
https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dgx/index.html#installing-frameworks-for-jetson

## Installing TensorRT

In order to make use of TF-TRT, you will need a local installation of TensorRT.
Installation instructions for compatibility with TensorFlow are provided on the
[TensorFlow GPU support](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu) guide.

## Examples

You can find example scripts for running inference on deep learning models in
this repository: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorrt

We have used these examples to verify the accuracy and performance of TF-TRT.
For more information see
[Verified Models](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tf-trt-user-guide/index.html#verified-models).

## Documentation

[TF-TRT documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tf-trt-user-guide/index.html)
gives an overview of the supported functionalities, provides tutorials and
verified models, explains best practices with troubleshooting guides.

## Tests

TF-TRT includes both Python tests and C++ unit tests. Most of Python tests are
located in the test directory and they can be executed using `bazel test` or
directly with the Python command. Most of the C++ unit tests are used to test
the conversion functions that convert each TF op to a number of TensorRT layers.

## Compilation

In order to compile the module, you need to have a local TensorRT installation
(libnvinfer.so and respective include files). During the configuration step,
TensorRT should be enabled and installation path should be set. If installed
through package managers (deb,rpm), configure script should find the necessary
components from the system automatically. If installed from tar packages, user
has to set path to location where the library is installed during configuration.

```shell
bazel build --config=cuda --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/
```
