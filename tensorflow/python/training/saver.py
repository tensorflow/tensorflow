  @compatibility(TF2)
  `tf.compat.v1.train.Saver` is not supported for saving and restoring
  checkpoints in TF2. Please switch to `tf.train.Checkpoint` or
  `tf.keras.Model.save_weights`, which perform a more robust [object-based
  saving](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/checkpoint#loading_mechanics).

  ### How to Rewrite Checkpoints

  Please rewrite your checkpoints immediately using the object-based checkpoint
  APIs.

  You can load a name-based checkpoint written by `tf.compat.v1.train.Saver`
  using `tf.train.Checkpoint.restore` or `tf.keras.Model.load_weights`. However,
  you may have to change the names of the variables in your model to match the
  variable names in the name-based checkpoint, which can be viewed with
  `tf.train.list_variables(path)`.

  Another option is to create an `assignment_map` that maps the name of the
  variables in the name-based checkpoint to the variables in your model, eg:
  ```
  {
      'sequential/dense/bias': model.variables[0],
      'sequential/dense/kernel': model.variables[1]
  }
  ```
  and use `tf.compat.v1.train.init_from_checkpoint(path, assignment_map)` to
  restore the name-based checkpoint.

  After restoring, re-encode your checkpoint
  using `tf.train.Checkpoint.save` or `tf.keras.Model.save_weights`.

  See the [Checkpoint compatibility](
  https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/migrate#checkpoint_compatibility)
  section of the migration guide for more details.


  ### Checkpoint Management in TF2

  Use `tf.train.CheckpointManager` to manage checkpoints in TF2.
  `tf.train.CheckpointManager` offers equivalent `keep_checkpoint_every_n_hours`
  and `max_to_keep` parameters.

  To recover the latest checkpoint,

  ```
  checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model)
  manager = tf.train.CheckpointManager(checkpoint)
  status = checkpoint.restore(manager.latest_checkpoint)
  ```

  `tf.train.CheckpointManager` also writes a [`CheckpointState` proto]
  (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/training/checkpoint_state.proto)
  which contains the timestamp when each checkpoint was created.

  ### Writing `MetaGraphDef`s in TF2

  To replace, `tf.compat.v1.train.Saver.save(write_meta_graph=True)`, use
  `tf.saved_model.save` to write the `MetaGraphDef` (which is contained in
  `saved_model.pb`).

  @end_compatibility

  See [Variables](https://tensorflow.org/guide/variables)
  for an overview of variables, saving and restoring.

  The `Saver` class adds ops to save and restore variables to and from
  *checkpoints*.  It also provides convenience methods to run these ops.

  Checkpoints are binary files in a proprietary format which map variable names
  to tensor values.  The best way to examine the contents of a checkpoint is to
  load it using a `Saver`.

  Savers can automatically number checkpoint filenames with a provided counter.
  This lets you keep multiple checkpoints at different steps while training a
  model.  For example you can number the checkpoint filenames with the training
  step number.  To avoid filling up disks, savers manage checkpoint files
  automatically. For example, they can keep only the N most recent files, or
  one checkpoint for every N hours of training.

  You number checkpoint filenames by passing a value to the optional
  `global_step` argument to `save()`:

  ```python
  saver.save(sess, 'my-model', global_step=0) ==> filename: 'my-model-0'
  ...
  saver.save(sess, 'my-model', global_step=1000) ==> filename: 'my-model-1000'
  ```

  Additionally, optional arguments to the `Saver()` constructor let you control
  the proliferation of checkpoint files on disk:

  * `max_to_keep` indicates the maximum number of recent checkpoint files to
    keep.  As new files are created, older files are deleted.   If None or 0,
    no checkpoints are deleted from the filesystem but only the last one is
    kept in the `checkpoint` file.  Defaults to 5 (that is, the 5 most recent
    checkpoint files are kept.)

  * `keep_checkpoint_every_n_hours`: In addition to keeping the most recent
    `max_to_keep` checkpoint files, you might want to keep one checkpoint file
    for every N hours of training.  This can be useful if you want to later
    analyze how a model progressed during a long training session.  For
    example, passing `keep_checkpoint_every_n_hours=2` ensures that you keep
    one checkpoint file for every 2 hours of training.  The default value of
    10,000 hours effectively disables the feature.

  Note that you still have to call the `save()` method to save the model.
  Passing these arguments to the constructor will not save variables
  automatically for you.

  A training program that saves regularly looks like:

  ```python
  ...
  # Create a saver.
  saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver(...variables...)
  # Launch the graph and train, saving the model every 1,000 steps.
  sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()
  for step in range(1000000):
      sess.run(..training_op..)
      if step % 1000 == 0:
          # Append the step number to the checkpoint name:
          saver.save(sess, 'my-model', global_step=step)
  ```

  In addition to checkpoint files, savers keep a protocol buffer on disk with
  the list of recent checkpoints. This is used to manage numbered checkpoint
  files and by `latest_checkpoint()`, which makes it easy to discover the path
  to the most recent checkpoint. That protocol buffer is stored in a file named
  'checkpoint' next to the checkpoint files.

  If you create several savers, you can specify a different filename for the
  protocol buffer file in the call to `save()`.

    """Creates a `Saver`.

    The constructor adds ops to save and restore variables.

    `var_list` specifies the variables that will be saved and restored. It can
    be passed as a `dict` or a list:

    * A `dict` of names to variables: The keys are the names that will be
      used to save or restore the variables in the checkpoint files.
    * A list of variables: The variables will be keyed with their op name in
      the checkpoint files.

    For example:

    ```python
    v1 = tf.Variable(..., name='v1')
    v2 = tf.Variable(..., name='v2')

    # Pass the variables as a dict:
    saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver({'v1': v1, 'v2': v2})

    # Or pass them as a list.
    saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver([v1, v2])
    # Passing a list is equivalent to passing a dict with the variable op names
    # as keys:
    saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver({v.op.name: v for v in [v1, v2]})
    ```

    Note: the newer `AutoTrackable` API is not supported by `Saver`. In this
    case, the `tf.train.Checkpoint` class should be used.

    The optional `reshape` argument, if `True`, allows restoring a variable from
    a save file where the variable had a different shape, but the same number
    of elements and type.  This is useful if you have reshaped a variable and
    want to reload it from an older checkpoint.

    The optional `sharded` argument, if `True`, instructs the saver to shard
    checkpoints per device.

    Args:
      var_list: A list of `Variable`/`SaveableObject`, or a dictionary mapping
        names to `SaveableObject`s. If `None`, defaults to the list of all
        saveable objects.
      reshape: If `True`, allows restoring parameters from a checkpoint where
        the variables have a different shape.
      sharded: If `True`, shard the checkpoints, one per device.
      max_to_keep: Maximum number of recent checkpoints to keep. Defaults to 5.
      keep_checkpoint_every_n_hours: How often to keep checkpoints. Defaults to
        10,000 hours.
      name: String.  Optional name to use as a prefix when adding operations.
      restore_sequentially: A `Bool`, which if true, causes restore of different
        variables to happen sequentially within each device.  This can lower
        memory usage when restoring very large models.
      saver_def: Optional `SaverDef` proto to use instead of running the
        builder. This is only useful for specialty code that wants to recreate a
        `Saver` object for a previously built `Graph` that had a `Saver`. The
        `saver_def` proto should be the one returned by the `as_saver_def()`
        call of the `Saver` that was created for that `Graph`.
      builder: Optional `SaverBuilder` to use if a `saver_def` was not provided.
        Defaults to `BulkSaverBuilder()`.
      defer_build: If `True`, defer adding the save and restore ops to the
        `build()` call. In that case `build()` should be called before
        finalizing the graph or using the saver.
      allow_empty: If `False` (default) raise an error if there are no variables
        in the graph. Otherwise, construct the saver anyway and make it a no-op.
      write_version: controls what format to use when saving checkpoints.  It
        also affects certain filepath matching logic.  The V2 format is the
        recommended choice: it is much more optimized than V1 in terms of memory
        required and latency incurred during restore.  Regardless of this flag,
        the Saver is able to restore from both V2 and V1 checkpoints.
      pad_step_number: if True, pads the global step number in the checkpoint
        filepaths to some fixed width (8 by default).  This is turned off by
        default.
      save_relative_paths: If `True`, will write relative paths to the
        checkpoint state file. This is needed if the user wants to copy the
        checkpoint directory and reload from the copied directory.
      filename: If known at graph construction time, filename used for variable
        loading/saving.

    Raises:
      TypeError: If `var_list` is invalid.
      ValueError: If any of the keys or values in `var_list` are not unique.
      RuntimeError: If eager execution is enabled and`var_list` does not specify
        a list of variables to save.

    @compatibility(eager)
    When eager execution is enabled, `var_list` must specify a `list` or `dict`

    Although Saver works in some cases when executing eagerly, it is
    fragile. Please switch to `tf.train.Checkpoint` or

    saving. These APIs will load checkpoints written by `Saver`.

  then adds all the nodes from the `graph_def` field to the

  In combination with `export_meta_graph()`, this function can be used to

  * Serialize a graph along with other Python objects such as `QueueRunner`,
    `Variable` into a `MetaGraphDef`.

  * Restart training from a saved graph and checkpoints.

  * Run inference from a saved graph and checkpoints.

  ```Python
  ...
  # Create a saver.
  saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver(...variables...)
  # Remember the training_op we want to run by adding it to a collection.
  tf.compat.v1.add_to_collection('train_op', train_op)

  for step in range(1000000):

          # named 'my-model-global_step.meta'.
          saver.save(sess, 'my-model', global_step=step)
  ```

  Later we can continue training from this saved `meta_graph` without building
  the model from scratch.

  ```Python
  with tf.Session() as sess:
    new_saver =
    tf.train.import_meta_graph('my-save-dir/my-model-10000.meta')
    new_saver.restore(sess, 'my-save-dir/my-model-10000')
    # tf.get_collection() returns a list. In this example we only want
    # the first one.
    train_op = tf.get_collection('train_op')[0]
    for step in range(1000000):
      sess.run(train_op)
  ```

  NOTE: Restarting training from saved `meta_graph` only works if the
  device assignments have not changed.

  Example:
  Variables, placeholders, and independent operations can also be stored, as
  shown in the following example.

  ```Python
  # Saving contents and operations.
  v1 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, name="v1")
  v2 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, name="v2")
  v3 = tf.math.multiply(v1, v2)
  vx = tf.Variable(10.0, name="vx")
  v4 = tf.add(v3, vx, name="v4")
  saver = tf.train.Saver([vx])
  sess = tf.Session()
  sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
  sess.run(vx.assign(tf.add(vx, vx)))
  result = sess.run(v4, feed_dict={v1:12.0, v2:3.3})
  print(result)
  saver.save(sess, "./model_ex1")
  ```

  Later this model can be restored and contents loaded.

  ```Python
  # Restoring variables and running operations.
  saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph("./model_ex1.meta")
  sess = tf.Session()
  saver.restore(sess, "./model_ex1")
  result = sess.run("v4:0", feed_dict={"v1:0": 12.0, "v2:0": 3.3})
  print(result)
  ```

  Args:
    meta_graph_or_file: `MetaGraphDef` protocol buffer or filename (including
      the path) containing a `MetaGraphDef`.
    clear_devices: Whether or not to clear the device field for an `Operation`
      or `Tensor` during import.
    import_scope: Optional `string`. Name scope to add. Only used when
      initializing from protocol buffer.
    **kwargs: Optional keyed arguments.

  Returns:
    A saver constructed from `saver_def` in `MetaGraphDef` or None.

    A None value is returned if no variables exist in the `MetaGraphDef`
    (i.e., there are no variables to restore).

  Raises:

  This function exports the graph, saver, and collection objects into
  `MetaGraphDef` protocol buffer with the intention of it being imported
  at a later time or location to restart training, run inference, or be
  a subgraph.

  Args:
    filename: Optional filename including the path for writing the generated
      `MetaGraphDef` protocol buffer.
    meta_info_def: `MetaInfoDef` protocol buffer.
    graph_def: `GraphDef` protocol buffer.

    as_text: If `True`, writes the `MetaGraphDef` as an ASCII proto.
    graph: The `Graph` to export. If `None`, use the default graph.
    export_scope: Optional `string`. Name scope under which to extract the
      subgraph. The scope name will be striped from the node definitions for
      easy import later into new name scopes. If `None`, the whole graph is

    clear_devices: Whether or not to clear the device field for an `Operation`
      or `Tensor` during export.
    clear_extraneous_savers: Remove any Saver-related information from the graph
      (both Save/Restore ops and SaverDefs) that are not associated with the
      provided SaverDef.
    strip_default_attrs: Boolean. If `True`, default-valued attributes will be
      removed from the NodeDefs. For a detailed guide, see [Stripping
      Default-Valued
      Attributes](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/saved_model/README.md#stripping-default-valued-attributes).

  This function validates that all variables in the variables list are remapped
  in the object-based checkpoint (or `names_to_keys` dict if provided). A
  saver will be created with the list of remapped variables.

  The `cached_saver` argument allows the user to pass in a previously created
  saver, so multiple `saver.restore()` calls don't pollute the graph when graph
  building. This assumes that keys are consistent, meaning that the
    1) `checkpoint_path` checkpoint, and

  are the same type of object-based checkpoint. If this argument is set, this

  Note that in general, `tf.train.Checkpoint` should be used to restore/save an
  object-based checkpoint.

  Args:
    checkpoint_path: string, path to object-based checkpoint
    var_list: list of `Variables` that appear in the checkpoint. If `None`,
      `var_list` will be set to all saveable objects.
