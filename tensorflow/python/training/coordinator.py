@tf_export("train.Coordinator")
class Coordinator:
  """A coordinator for threads.

  This class implements a simple mechanism to coordinate the termination of a
  set of threads.

  #### Usage:

  ```python
  # Create a coordinator.
  coord = Coordinator()
  # Start a number of threads, passing the coordinator to each of them.
  ...start thread 1...(coord, ...)
  ...start thread N...(coord, ...)
  # Wait for all the threads to terminate.
  coord.join(threads)
  ```

  Any of the threads can call `coord.request_stop()` to ask for all the threads
  to stop.  To cooperate with the requests, each thread must check for
  `coord.should_stop()` on a regular basis.  `coord.should_stop()` returns
  `True` as soon as `coord.request_stop()` has been called.

  A typical thread running with a coordinator will do something like:

  ```python
  while not coord.should_stop():
    ...do some work...
  ```

  #### Exception handling:

  A thread can report an exception to the coordinator as part of the
  `request_stop()` call.  The exception will be re-raised from the
  `coord.join()` call.

  Thread code:

  ```python
  try:
    while not coord.should_stop():
      ...do some work...
  except Exception as e:
    coord.request_stop(e)
  ```

  Main code:

  ```python
  try:
    ...
    coord = Coordinator()
    # Start a number of threads, passing the coordinator to each of them.
    ...start thread 1...(coord, ...)
    ...start thread N...(coord, ...)
    # Wait for all the threads to terminate.
    coord.join(threads)
  except Exception as e:
    ...exception that was passed to coord.request_stop()
  ```

  To simplify the thread implementation, the Coordinator provides a
  context handler `stop_on_exception()` that automatically requests a stop if
  an exception is raised.  Using the context handler the thread code above
  can be written as:

  ```python
  with coord.stop_on_exception():
    while not coord.should_stop():
      ...do some work...
  ```

  #### Grace period for stopping:

  After a thread has called `coord.request_stop()` the other threads have a
  fixed time to stop, this is called the 'stop grace period' and defaults to 2
  minutes.  If any of the threads is still alive after the grace period expires
  `coord.join()` raises a RuntimeError reporting the laggards.

  ```python
  try:
    ...
    coord = Coordinator()
    # Start a number of threads, passing the coordinator to each of them.
    ...start thread 1...(coord, ...)
    ...start thread N...(coord, ...)
    # Wait for all the threads to terminate, give them 10s grace period
    coord.join(threads, stop_grace_period_secs=10)
  except RuntimeError:
    ...one of the threads took more than 10s to stop after request_stop()
    ...was called.
  except Exception:
    ...exception that was passed to coord.request_stop()
  ```
