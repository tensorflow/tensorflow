"""## Functions for working with arbitrarily nested sequences of elements.

This module can perform operations on nested structures. A nested structure is a
Python sequence, tuple (including `namedtuple`), or dict that can contain
further sequences, tuples, and dicts.

The utilities here assume (and do not check) that the nested structures form a
'tree', i.e., no references in the structure of the input of these functions
should be recursive.

Example structures: `((3, 4), 5, (6, 7, (9, 10), 8))`, `(np.array(0),
  (np.array([3, 4]), tf.constant([3, 4])))`
