  Each `CompositeTensor` can be decomposed into a structured collection of
  component `tf.Tensor`s, and reconstructed from those components.

  The `tensorflow.python.util.nest` module has support for treating composite
  tensors as structure, which makes it easy to flatten and reconstruct
  composite tensors (or larger structures that contain composite tensors).
  E.g.:

  ```python
  ct = ...  # Create a composite tensor.
  flat_list_of_tensors = nest.flatten(ct, expand_composites=True)
  transformed_list_of_tensors = ...  # do something with the flat tensors.
  result = nest.pack_sequence_as(ct, transformed_list_of_tensors,

# from Python objects to tensors. The usual encoding is "component encoding"
# which uses the dense tensors that represent a composite tensor.
# A second encoding, "batchable tensor list encoding", is used by datasets
# and map_fn which in addition to supporting batching also can use ops
# for encoding and decoding, e.g. for encoding/decoding to/from a
# single variant that represents a composite tensor. Some internal properties
# for type specs for composite tensors use `flat` as a nickname for
# "batchable tensor list encoding". (e.g. `flat_tensor_specs`).
