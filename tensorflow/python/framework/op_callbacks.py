def add_op_callback(callback_fn):
  r"""Add a thread-local callback that intercepts op execution and op creation.

  The `callback_fn` will be invoked immediately after any of the three types
  of events:
    - The execution of an TensorFlow operation ("op" for short hereafter)
      under eager mode,
    - The execution of a FuncGraph under eager mode,
    - The creation of an op during graph construction (e.g., in
      @tf.function-decorated Python functions).

  Known limitations:
    1. Under graph mode, overriding the output tensors of control-flow ops,
       including "If", "StatelessIf" and "While", may cause errors
       (b/139668453). Overriding other tensors in a graph consisting of such
       control-flow ops is okay.
    2. Under eager mode, calling eager ops from the callback function itself
       may lead to recursion stack overflow. This can be prevented by
       returning from the callback function immediately on encountering the
       op type involved (b/140334369).

  Args:
    callback_fn: A callback_fn that has the following signature: def
      callback_fn(op_type, inputs, attrs, outputs, op_name=None, graph=None): #
      op_type: The type of the op, as a string. E.g., "MatMul". #          For
        the special case of FuncGraph execution, op_type #          takes the
        name of the graph name, e.g., #          "__inference_my_func_24". #
        inputs: (`tuple` of `Tensor`s) Input tensors to the op or the #
        FuncGraph. #         - In eager execution, these are `EagerTensor`s. #
        - In graph construction, these are non-eager `Tensor`s #           that
        form the inputs to the just-created op. # attrs: The attributes of the
        op or FuncGraph of which the execution #        or creation caused the
        current invocation of the callback. #        This is applicable to both
        eager- and graph-based execution, #        as well as graph
        construction. # This is a tuple of alternating attribute keys and
        attribute # values. E.g., `('adjoint_a', False, 'adjoint_b', False)`. #
        outputs: (`tuple of `Tensor`s) Output tensors from the op or #
        FuncGraph. #          In eager execution, these are `EagerTensor`s. #
        In graph construction, these are non-eager `Tensor`s that #          are
        the outputs of the just-created op. # op_name: Name of the op. #
        - If the current invocation of the callback is due to the #
        eager execution of an op or FuncGraph, this will be #            `None`,
        as op names are meaningless in eager execution. #          - In graph
        construction, this is the name of the op, e.g., #            "MatMul_2".
        #
      graph: The graph that the op belongs to (if any). #        - In eager
        execution of an op or FuncGraph, this is `None`. #        - In graph
        construction, this is the op's enclosing graph #          as a
        `tf.Graph` object. # # Return values: #   This callback function is
        expected to return `None` or #   a `list` or `tuple` of `Tensor`s with
        its length matching #   `len(outputs)`, in the order that corresponds to
        that of the #   `outputs` argument. #   If the return value is `None`,
        downstream execution or graph #   construction will be unaffected. #
        However, if the return value is a `list` or `tuple` of `Tensor`s, #   -
        In eager execution, these returned `Tensor`s should be #
        `EagerTensor`s. Their values will replace the original values of #
        `outputs` for downstream eager execution. (*Not implemented yet*). #   -
        In graph construction, these returned `Tensor`s should be #
        non-eager `Tensor`s. Their values will replace the original #
        `outputs` for downstream graph construction.
