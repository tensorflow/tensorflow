"""Library imports for ClusterResolvers.

  This library contains all implementations of ClusterResolvers.
  ClusterResolvers are a way of specifying cluster information for distributed
  execution. Built on top of existing `ClusterSpec` framework, ClusterResolvers
  are a way for TensorFlow to communicate with various cluster management
  systems (e.g. GCE, AWS, etc...).
