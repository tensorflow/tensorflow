    #   In this case each thread can successfully trace its own function, but
    #   since the `merge_fn` passed to `merge_call` is executed in the main
    #   thread (where `_call_for_each_replica` is executed), it can't access
    #   the tensors that come from different graphs.
    #
    #   3. The `fn` passed to `_call_for_each_replica` contains a control-flow

    #   `fn` or `_call_for_each_replica` is decorated with `tf.function`.
