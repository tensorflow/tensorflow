"""Module for `PreemptionCheckpointHandler`.

This is currently under development and the API is subject to change.

PreemptionCheckpointHandler reduces loss of training progress caused by
termination (preemption or maintenance) of workers in multi-worker synchronous
training and avoid surfacing an error indistinguishable from application errors
to the job scheduler or users.

class TerminationConfig(object):
  """Customization of `PreemptionCheckpointHandler` for various platforms.

  A `TerminationConfig` can be created and passed to a
  `tf.distribute.experimental.PreemptionCheckpointHandler` to provide
  customization based on the platform. It can deliver three pieces of
  information:

  * How to decide if there is a termination event soon

  The form of termination notification and how to fetch it vary across
  platforms. Thus `PreemptionCheckpointHandler` may take a user-defined
  function, `termination_watcher_fn`, and execute it repeatedly to check for
  termination notification. `termination_watcher_fn` should be a function
  that returns `True` if a termination notification is available and
  `False` otherwise. The function should be lightweight and non-blocking so that
  resources can be cleaned up properly if no termination signal is ever raised
  until training finishes.

  * How to exit the program

  A user can configure this through the `exit_fn`, which
  `PreemptionCheckpointHandler` executes after saving the checkpoint to exit the
  training program gracefully. For `tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`,
  a restart is necessary to reset the program's state. However, having a
  customized `exit_fn` may facilitate the restart and smoothen the training
  experience. How so? Maybe the platform has an agreement to a `RESTART_CODE`
  recognized as a program auto-restart signal, or maybe the user has a
  coordinating script that starts up the training, in which they can configure
  the program to auto-restart if it ever exits with this `RESTART_CODE`. In both
  cases, configuring the `exit_fn` to be `sys.exit(RESTART_CODE)` makes the
  training seamless.

  * How long does `PreemptionCheckpointHandler` have from receiving a
  termination event notice till the actual termination

  Some platforms have a gap time as long as one hour or so. In these cases,
  there is the option to utilize this gap time for training as much as possible
  before saving a checkpoint and exiting. This can be achieved by passing the
  `grace_period` argument a nonzero value. Note, for a user with a grace period
  that is not multiple times longer than their checkpoint writing time (e.g.,
  three times or more), we advise not to configure this argument, in which case
  `PreemptionCheckpointHandler` will directly save a checkpoint and exit.


  **The default behavior**:

  * For Google Borg Platform:
      * Automatically know how to detect preemption signal
      * Exit with a platform-recognized restart code
      * Save a checkpoint and exit immediately

  * For Google Cloud Platform:
      * Automatically know how to detect maintenance signal.
      * Exit with a code (User may configure this)
      * Automatically utilized the extended training period before save and exit

  * For Other platform:
      * If `termination_watcher_fn` is `None`, we will treat `signal.SIGTERM` as
      a termination signal.
      * If `exit_fn` is not configured, we exit the program with an arbitrary
      code.
      * If `grace_period` is not configured, we will wrap up the current
      training step, save a checkpoint, and exit the program as soon as we
      receive the termination signal.

# TODO(wxinyi): add release updates.
# Implementation:
# Each worker will create its own PreemptionCheckpointHandler instance, and the
# instances communicate through coordination services. Each
# PreemptionCheckpointHandler conduct three tasks in parallel:
# - Watches out for its own preemption signal. (_poll_termination_signal_thread)
# - Watches out for a step key from the coordination service made available
#   by any member in the cluster (_cluster_wise_termination_watcher_thread)
# - The main thread for training.
#
# The life cycle of a PreemptionCheckpointHandler is as below:
#
# It starts two threads as two watcher as described above. And it starts
# training. Each time before it starts a training step, it will check if any
# information has been made available by the two watchers: The
# _poll_termination_signal_thread will be in charge of the _received_own_sigterm
# event, the _cluster_wise_termination_watcher_thread will be in charge of the
# _received_checkpoint_step event.
#
# If at any point the local worker receives a preemption signal,
# _poll_termination_signal_thread will set _received_own_sigterm.
# Next time before it attempts to run a training step, it will deal with the
# event, by setting its current finished step + 1 as the step after which a
# checkpoint should be saved and make it available to all the workers through
# the coordination service. It will then continue training.
#
# This step key will be picked up by the other watcher,
# _cluster_wise_termination_watcher_thread, both on the worker to be preempted
# and other workers. And it will set the _received_checkpoint_step event.
# Now, if there is a long grace period before the training
# has to terminate (e.g., an hour), we would like to keep training and save a
# checkpoint again right before the termination. Thus this watcher thread will
# move on to watch out for a final step-to-save key. Otherwise,
# it has finished all the task to do.
#
# Back to the main training thread. Again, before the next training step, the
# PreemptionCheckpointHandler found that _received_checkpoint_step is set. If
# the local worker has not finished the required step after which to save a
# checkpoint, it will not do anything. Continue training and it will revisit
# after another step. If the step is met, then it will save a checkpoint,
# which requires participation of all workers.
#
# After this checkpoint is saved, if there is NO long grace period, all workers
# will just exit. If there is, all workers will enter a grace period countdown
# phase (_final_checkpoint_countdown) and clear the _received_checkpoint_step
# event. They will then continue training.
#
# For the worker to be preempted, during this countdown period, it will check
# whether the grace period is almost ending before its every step. If not,
# nothing needs to be done. If so, it will again set a step-to-save key and made
# it available to all workers. This is still watched by
# _cluster_wise_termination_watcher_thread and gestured by
# _received_checkpoint_step. A similar process is repeated: all workers save
# a checkpoint at an agreed step. And after they finish saving, they recognize
# that they have finished a countdown period for an extended grace period, and
# they all exit.
#
# When the program restarts and PreemptionCheckpointHandler object is created,
# it will restore the checkpoint.

  """Preemption and error handler for synchronous training.

  Note: This API only supports use with
  `tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` and `tf.distribute.TPUStrategy`.

  A `PreemptionCheckpointHandler` coordinates all workers to save a checkpoint
  upon receiving a preemption signal. It also helps disseminate application
  error messages accurately among the cluster. When a
  `PreemptionCheckpointHandler` object is created, it restores values from
  the latest checkpoint file if any exists.

  Right after the initialization, the object starts to watch out for termination
  signal for any member in the cluster. If receiving a signal, the next time the
  worker executes `PreemptionCheckpointHandler.run`, the
  `PreemptionCheckpointHandler` will align all workers to save a checkpoint.
  Then, if an `exit_fn` is configured via
  `tf.distribute.experimental.TerminationConfig`, it will be invoked. Otherwise,
  the process will simply exit and later the platform should restart it.

  Note: We advise users of `tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` who
  choose to configure their
  own `exit_fn` in `tf.distribute.experimental.TerminationConfig` to include a
  `sys.exit(CODE_OR_MESSAGE)` in the `exit_fn` so that after the restart, all
  workers can initialize communication services correctly. For users of
  `tf.distribute.TPUStrategy`, if they do not wish to do a cluster restart but
  would like an in-process restart (i.e., keep the coordinator alive and re-do
  the steps to connect to cluster, initialize TPU system, and make the
  `TPUStrategy` object), they could configure the `exit_fn` to a no-op.

  For users of `tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`, the core API is
  `PreemptionCheckpointHandler.run`:

  ```python
  strategy = tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy()

  trained_epoch = tf.Variable(initial_value=tf.constant(0, dtype=tf.dtypes.int64), name='epoch')
  step_in_epoch = tf.Variable(initial_value=tf.constant(0, dtype=tf.dtypes.int64), name='step_in_epoch')

  with strategy.scope():
    dataset, model, optimizer = ...

    checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(optimizer=optimizer,
                                     model=model,
                                     trained_epoch=trained_epoch,
                                     step_in_epoch=step_in_epoch)

    preemption_checkpoint_handler = tf.distribute.experimental.PreemptionCheckpointHandler(cluster_resolver, checkpoint, checkpoint_dir)

  while trained_epoch.numpy() < NUM_EPOCH:

    while step_in_epoch.numpy() < STEPS_PER_EPOCH:

      # distributed_train_function contains a call to strategy.run.
      loss += preemption_checkpoint_handler.run(distributed_train_function, args=(next(iterator),))
      # For users of MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy, usually
      # STEPS_PER_TRAIN_FUNCTION = 1.
      step_in_epoch.assign_add(STEPS_PER_TRAIN_FUNCTION)
      ...

    epoch.assign_add(1)
    step_in_epoch.assign(0)
  ```

  For users of `tf.distribute.TPUStrategy`, the core APIs are
  `PreemptionCheckpointHandler.run` and
  `PreemptionCheckpointHandler.watch_preemption_scope`:

  ```python

  strategy = tf.distribute.TPUStrategy(tpu_cluster_resolver)

  # Rest of TPU init omitted, see documentation for TPUSTrategy.

  with preemption_checkpoint_handler.watch_preemption_scope():
    while trained_epoch.numpy() < NUM_EPOCH:

      while step_in_epoch.numpy() < STEPS_PER_EPOCH:

        # distributed_train_function contains a call to strategy.run.
        loss += preemption_checkpoint_handler.run(distributed_train_function, args=(next(iterator),))

        # For users of TPUStrategy, usually STEPS_PER_TRAIN_FUNCTION >> 1 since
        # clustering multiple steps within a tf.function amortizes the overhead
        # of launching a multi-device function on TPU Pod.
        step_in_epoch.assign_add(STEPS_PER_TRAIN_FUNCTION)
        ...

      epoch.assign_add(1)
      step_in_epoch.assign(0)
  ```

  Not all interruptions come with advance notice so that the
  `PreemptionCheckpointHandler` can handle them, e.g., those caused by hardware
  failure. For a user who saves checkpoints for these cases themselves outside
  the `PreemptionCheckpointHandler`, if they are using a
  `tf.train.CheckpointManager`, pass it as the
  `checkpoint_or_checkpoint_manager` argument to the
  `PreemptionCheckpointHandler`. If they do not have a
  `tf.train.CheckpointManager` but are directly working with
  `tf.train.Checkpoint`, we advise saving the checkpoints in the directory
  that's passed as the `checkpoint_dir` argument. In this way, at the program
  beginning, `PreemptionCheckpointHandler` can restore the latest checkpoint
  from the directory, no matter it's saved by the user themselves or saved by
  the `PreemptionCheckpointHandler` before preemption happens.

  **A note on the platform:**

  `PreemptionCheckpointHandler` can only handle the kind of termination with
  advance notice. For now, the API recognizes the termination signal for CPU,
  GPU, and TPU on Google Borg and CPU and GPU on the Google Cloud Platform. In
  these cases, `PreemptionCheckpointHandler` will automatically adopt the
  correct preemption/maintenance notification detection mechanism. Users of
  other platforms can configure a detection monitoring behavior through the
  `tf.distribute.experimental.TerminationConfig`. Customization for the exit
  behavior and grace period length could also be done here.

    This function handles preemption signal reported by any worker in the

    maximum of 1.
    - If the signal comes from the worker itself (i.e., where this failure
    handler sits), the worker will notify all peers to checkpoint after they
    finish CURRENT_STEP+1 steps, where CURRENT_STEP is the step this worker has
    just finished. And the worker will wait for all peers to acknowledge that
    they have received its preemption signal and the final-step number before
    the worker proceeds on training the final step.
    - If the signal comes from another member in the cluster but NO final-step
    info is available, proceed on training, because it will be available after
    finishing the next step.
    - If the signal comes from some other member in the cluster, and final-step
    info is available, if the worker has not finished these steps yet, keep
    training; otherwise, checkpoint and exit with a cluster-recognized restart
