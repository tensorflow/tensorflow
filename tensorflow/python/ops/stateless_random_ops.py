def index_shuffle(index, seed, max_index):
  """Outputs the position of `index` in a permutation of `[0, ..., max_index]`.

  For each possible `seed` and `max_index` there is one pseudorandom
  permutation of the sequence `S=[0, ..., max_index]`. Instead of
  materializing the full array we can compute the new position of any
  integer `i` (`0 <= i <= max_index`) in `S`. This can be useful for
  very large `max_index`s by avoiding allocating large chunks of
  memory.

  In the simplest case, `index` and `max_index` are scalars, and
  `seed` is a length-2 vector (as typical for stateless RNGs). But
  you can add a leading batch dimension to all of them. If some of
  them don't have the batch dimension while others do, `index_shuffle`
  will add a batch dimension to the former by broadcasting.

  The input `index` and output can be used as indices to shuffle a
  vector.  For example:

  >>> vector = tf.constant(['e0', 'e1', 'e2', 'e3'])
  >>> indices = tf.random.experimental.index_shuffle(
  ...   index=tf.range(4), seed=[5, 9], max_index=3)
  >>> print(indices)

  >>> shuffled_vector = tf.gather(vector, indices)
  >>> print(shuffled_vector)
  tf.Tensor([b'e2' b'e0' b'e1' b'e3'], shape=(4,), dtype=string)

  More usefully, it can be used in a streaming (aka online) scenario such as
  `tf.data`, where each element of `vector` is processed individually and the
  whole `vector` is never materialized in memory.

  >>> dataset = tf.data.Dataset.range(10)
  >>> dataset = dataset.map(
  ...  lambda idx: tf.random.experimental.index_shuffle(idx, [5, 8], 9))
  >>> [a.item() for a in dataset.as_numpy_iterator()]
  [3, 8, 0, 1, 2, 7, 6, 9, 4, 5]

  This operation is stateless (like the `tf.random.stateless_*`
  functions), meaning the output is fully determined by the `seed`
  (other inputs being equal).  Each `seed` choice corresponds to one
  permutation, so when calling this function multiple times for the
  same shuffling, please make sure to use the same `seed`. For
  example:

  >>> seed = [5, 9]
  >>> idx0 = tf.random.experimental.index_shuffle(0, seed, 3)
  >>> idx1 = tf.random.experimental.index_shuffle(1, seed, 3)
  >>> idx2 = tf.random.experimental.index_shuffle(2, seed, 3)

  Args:
    index: An integer scalar tensor or vector with values in `[0, max_index]`.
      It can be seen as either a value `v` in the sequence `S=[0, ...,
      max_index]` to be permutated, or as an index of an element `e` in a
      shuffled vector.
    seed: A tensor of shape [2] or [n, 2] with dtype `int32`, `uint32`, `int64`
      or `uint64`.  The RNG seed. If the rank is unknown during graph-building
      time it must be 1 at runtime.
    max_index: A non-negative tensor with the same shape and dtype as `index`.
      The upper bound (inclusive).

  Returns:
    If all inputs were scalar (shape [2] for `seed`), the output will
    be a scalar with the same dtype as `index`. The output can be seen
    as the new position of `v` in `S`, or as the index of `e` in the
    vector before shuffling.  If one or multiple inputs were vectors
    (shape [n, 2] for `seed`), then the output will be a vector of the
    same size which each element shuffled independently. Scalar values
    are broadcasted in this case.

  This is a stateless version of `tf.random.gamma`: if run twice with the same
  seeds and shapes, it will produce the same pseudorandom numbers. The output is
  consistent across multiple runs on the same hardware (and between CPU and

  but may change between versions of TensorFlow or on non-CPU/GPU hardware.

  A slight difference exists in the interpretation of the `shape` parameter
  between `stateless_gamma` and `gamma`: in `gamma`, the `shape` is always
  prepended to the shape of the broadcast of `alpha` with `beta`; whereas in
  `stateless_gamma` the `shape` parameter must always encompass the shapes of
  each of `alpha` and `beta` (which must broadcast together to match the
  trailing dimensions of `shape`).

  Note: Because internal calculations are done using `float64` and casting has
  `floor` semantics, we must manually map zero outcomes to the smallest
  possible positive floating-point value, i.e., `np.finfo(dtype).tiny`.  This
  means that `np.finfo(dtype).tiny` occurs more frequently than it otherwise
  should.  This bias can only happen for small values of `alpha`, i.e.,
  `alpha << 1` or large values of `beta`, i.e., `beta >> 1`.

  """Outputs deterministic pseudorandom values from a Poisson distribution.

  The generated values follow a Poisson distribution with specified rate
  parameter.

  This is a stateless version of `tf.random.poisson`: if run twice with the same
  seeds and shapes, it will produce the same pseudorandom numbers. The output is
  consistent across multiple runs on the same hardware, but may change between
  versions of TensorFlow or on non-CPU/GPU hardware.

  A slight difference exists in the interpretation of the `shape` parameter
  between `stateless_poisson` and `poisson`: in `poisson`, the `shape` is always
  prepended to the shape of `lam`; whereas in `stateless_poisson` the shape of
  `lam` must match the trailing dimensions of `shape`.

  Example:

  ```python
  samples = tf.random.stateless_poisson([10, 2], seed=[12, 34], lam=[5, 15])
  # samples has shape [10, 2], where each slice [:, 0] and [:, 1] represents

  # represents the 7x5 samples drawn from each of the two distributions

    lam: Tensor. The rate parameter "lambda" of the Poisson distribution. Shape
      must match the rightmost dimensions of `shape`.
    dtype: Dtype of the samples (int or float dtypes are permissible, as samples
      are discrete). Default: int32.
