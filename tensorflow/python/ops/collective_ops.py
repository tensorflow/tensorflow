  be known ahead of time in their most specific form so that the receive
  side can allocate memory for the operation and shape/type inference can
  carry forward from there.  Including the same declarations on the
  send side clarifies a commitment already made.  Secondly, having nearly
  identical use syntax for send and receive sides may simplify tool-driven
