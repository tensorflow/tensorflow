        The <a href="https://mlir.llvm.org/" class="external">MLIR</a> project defines a common
        intermediate representation (IR) that unifies the infrastructure required to execute high
        performance machine learning models in TensorFlow and similar ML frameworks. This project
        will include the application of HPC techniques, along with integration of
        search algorithms like reinforcement learning. MLIR aims to reduce the
        cost to bring up new hardware, and improve usability for existing
        TensorFlow users.
