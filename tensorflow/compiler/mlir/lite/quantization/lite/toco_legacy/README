This folder organizes legacy toco quantize_weights and its dependencies for easy
deletion, per go/tfl_split_quantize_weights.

When the MLIR quantizer replaces the legacy TOCO quantizer entirely, this entire
folder should be deleted. The partial copies of utils in this folder should not
be used anywhere but to support the legacy TOCO quantizer in this folder for
a clean and easy deletion.
