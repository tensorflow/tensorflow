class Flask(_PackageBoundObject):
    """The flask object implements a WSGI application and acts as the central
    object.  It is passed the name of the module or package of the
    application.  Once it is created it will act as a central registry for
    the view functions, the URL rules, template configuration and much more.

    The name of the package is used to resolve resources from inside the
    package or the folder the module is contained in depending on if the
    package parameter resolves to an actual python package (a folder with
    an :file:`__init__.py` file inside) or a standard module (just a ``.py`` file).

    For more information about resource loading, see :func:`open_resource`.

    Usually you create a :class:`Flask` instance in your main module or
    in the :file:`__init__.py` file of your package like this::

        from flask import Flask
        app = Flask(__name__)

    .. admonition:: About the First Parameter

        The idea of the first parameter is to give Flask an idea of what
        belongs to your application.  This name is used to find resources
        on the filesystem, can be used by extensions to improve debugging
        information and a lot more.

        So it's important what you provide there.  If you are using a single
        module, `__name__` is always the correct value.  If you however are
        using a package, it's usually recommended to hardcode the name of
        your package there.

        For example if your application is defined in :file:`yourapplication/app.py`
        you should create it with one of the two versions below::

            app = Flask('yourapplication')
            app = Flask(__name__.split('.')[0])

        Why is that?  The application will work even with `__name__`, thanks
        to how resources are looked up.  However it will make debugging more
        painful.  Certain extensions can make assumptions based on the
        import name of your application.  For example the Flask-SQLAlchemy
        extension will look for the code in your application that triggered
        an SQL query in debug mode.  If the import name is not properly set
        up, that debugging information is lost.  (For example it would only
        pick up SQL queries in `yourapplication.app` and not
        `yourapplication.views.frontend`)

       The `static_url_path`, `static_folder`, and `template_folder`
       parameters were added.

       The `instance_path` and `instance_relative_config` parameters were
       added.

    .. versionadded:: 0.11
       The `root_path` parameter was added.

    :param import_name: the name of the application package
    :param static_url_path: can be used to specify a different path for the
                            static files on the web.  Defaults to the name
                            of the `static_folder` folder.
    :param static_folder: the folder with static files that should be served
                          at `static_url_path`.  Defaults to the ``'static'``
                          folder in the root path of the application.
    :param template_folder: the folder that contains the templates that should
                            be used by the application.  Defaults to
                            ``'templates'`` folder in the root path of the
                            application.
    :param instance_path: An alternative instance path for the application.
                          By default the folder ``'instance'`` next to the
                          package or module is assumed to be the instance
                          path.
    :param instance_relative_config: if set to ``True`` relative filenames
                                     for loading the config are assumed to
                                     be relative to the instance path instead
                                     of the application root.
    :param root_path: Flask by default will automatically calculate the path
                      to the root of the application.  In certain situations
                      this cannot be achieved (for instance if the package
                      is a Python 3 namespace package) and needs to be
                      manually defined.

        """Creates a :class:`~flask.ctx.RequestContext` from the given
        environment and binds it to the current context.  This must be used in
        combination with the ``with`` statement because the request is only bound
        to the current context for the duration of the ``with`` block.

        Example usage::

            with app.request_context(environ):
                do_something_with(request)

        The object returned can also be used without the ``with`` statement
        which is useful for working in the shell.  The example above is
        doing exactly the same as this code::

            ctx = app.request_context(environ)
            ctx.push()
            try:
                do_something_with(request)
            finally:
                ctx.pop()

        .. versionchanged:: 0.3
           Added support for non-with statement usage and ``with`` statement
           is now passed the ctx object.
