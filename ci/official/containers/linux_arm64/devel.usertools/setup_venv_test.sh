# Run this from inside the tensorflow github directory.
# Usage: setup_venv_test.sh venv_and_symlink_name "glob pattern for one wheel file"
# Example: setup_venv_test.sh bazel_pip "/tf/pkg/*.whl"
# 
# This will create a venv with that wheel file installed in it, and a symlink
# in ./venv_and_symlink_name/tensorflow to ./tensorflow. We use this for the
# "pip" tests.
