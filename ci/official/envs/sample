# Sample of a local build environment.
#
# Copy this file into your own location (tensorflow/build_output is a good one)
# and change "your_choice_here" to one of the official enviroments you want to
# replicate. Then you can change additional settings below.
# Afterwards, run "export TFCI=$(realpath path-to-your-env-file)" and execute
# a build script to run it with your custom settings.
# TFCI_GIT_DIR is set automatically by tensorflow/ci/official/utilities/setup.sh
# "set +u ... set -u" ignores unknown CI variables, like $KOKORO_XYZ, since
# they'll be overwritten anyway.
set +u; source ci/official/envs/your_choice_here; set -u

# Reset bazel common options. This combines a local disk cache and
# TensorFlow's remote cache to speed up your builds. The "nightly" branch has
# the most content cached. TFCI_BAZEL_COMMON_ARGS is also where we target
# different Python versions. You can add e.g. "--repo_env=TF_PYTHON_VERSION=$TFCI_PYTHON_VERSION"
# to change the Python version to anything available (including the default) in
# tensorflow/tools/toolchains/python/python_repo.bzl.
TFCI_BAZEL_COMMON_ARGS=(--config tf_public_cache --disk_cache=build_output/cache)

# Disable all CI-specific behavior. You never need any of these if you are
# running a script locally.
TFCI_INDEX_HTML_ENABLE=
source ci/official/envs/disable_all_uploads

# You can add other custom settings below.
# 
# Just for reference, you can dump the resolved contents of an env with
# something like the following:
# 
# cd tensorflow_root_directory
# bash -c "set -a; set -o posix; source ci/official/envs/MYENV; set" | grep TFCI
