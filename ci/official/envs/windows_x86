# TODO(belitskiy): Add a link to the Dockerfile comment that explains this more.
# Used to simulate a T:\ drive within the container, to a limited extent,
# via a symlink.
# Helpful since the internal CI utilizes a T:\ drive, part of which is mounted
# to the container, and would result in C:\<path> != T:\<path> mismatches,
# when using variables like `TFCI_OUTPUT_DIR` in `docker exec commands,
# requiring conditional path adjustments throughout the CI scripts.
# Note: This does not work for `docker cp` commands.

# Docker on Windows doesn't support the `host` networking mode, and so
# port-forwarding is required for the container to detect it's running on GCE.
