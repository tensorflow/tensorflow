# Cuda Comment
cuda_comment: >
   From the template it looks like you are installing **TensorFlow** (TF) prebuilt binaries:
      * For TF-GPU - See point 1
      * For TF-CPU - See point 2
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   **1. Installing **TensorFlow-GPU** (TF) prebuilt binaries**
   
   
   Make sure you are using compatible TF and CUDA versions.
   Please refer following TF version and CUDA version compatibility table.
   
   | TF  | CUDA |
   
   | :-------------: | :-------------: |
   
   | 2.5.0  | 11.2 |
   
   | 2.4.0  | 11.0 |
   
   | 2.1.0 - 2.3.0  | 10.1 |
   
   | 1.13.1 - 2.0  | 10.0  |
   
   | 1.5.0 - 1.12.0 | 9.0 |
   
     * If you have above configuration and using _**Windows**_ platform -
       * Try adding the CUDA, CUPTI, and cuDNN installation directories to the %PATH% environment variable.
       * Refer [windows setup guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu#windows_setup).
     * If you have above configuration and using _**Ubuntu/Linux**_ platform -
       * Try adding the CUDA, CUPTI, and cuDNN installation directories to the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
       * Refer [linux setup guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu#linux_setup).
     * If error still persists then, apparently your CPU model does not support AVX instruction sets.
       * Refer [hardware requirements](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#hardware-requirements).
   
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   **2. Installing **TensorFlow** (TF) CPU prebuilt binaries**
   
   
   *TensorFlow release binaries version 1.6 and higher are prebuilt with AVX instruction sets.*
   
   
   Therefore on any CPU that does not have these instruction sets, either CPU or GPU version of TF will fail to load.
   
   Apparently, your CPU model does not support AVX instruction sets. You can still use TensorFlow with the alternatives given below:
   
      * Try Google Colab to use TensorFlow.
         * The easiest way to use TF will be to switch to [google colab](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true). You get pre-installed latest stable TF version. Also you can use ```pip install```  to install any other preferred TF version.
         * It has an added advantage since you can you easily switch to different hardware accelerators (cpu, gpu, tpu) as per the task.
         * All you need is a good internet connection and you are all set.
      * Try to build TF from sources by changing CPU optimization flags.
   
   *Please let us know if this helps.*
   
windows_comment: >
   From the stack trace it looks like you are hitting windows path length limit.
      * Try to disable path length limit on Windows 10.
        * Refer [disable path length limit instructions guide.](https://mspoweruser.com/ntfs-260-character-windows-10/)
   
   Please let us know if this helps.
